<p class="gutsumm">Arrival at Padron&mdash;Projected
Enterprise&mdash;The Alquilador&mdash;Breach of Promise&mdash;An
Odd Companion&mdash;A Plain Story&mdash;Rugged Paths&mdash;The
Desertion&mdash;The Pony&mdash;A Dialogue&mdash;Unpleasant
Situation&mdash;The Estadea&mdash;Benighted&mdash;The
Hut&mdash;The Traveller&rsquo;s Pillow.</p>
<p>I arrived at Padron late in the evening, on my return from
Pontevedra and Vigo.&nbsp; It was my intention at this place to
send my servant and horses forward to Santiago, and to hire a
guide to Cape Finisterre.&nbsp; It would be difficult to assign
any plausible reason for the ardent desire which I entertained to
visit this place; but I remembered that last year I had escaped
almost by a miracle from shipwreck and death on the rocky sides
of this extreme point of the Old World, and I thought that to
convey the Gospel to a place so wild and remote might perhaps be
considered an acceptable pilgrimage in the eyes of my
Maker.&nbsp; True it is that but one copy remained of those which
I had brought with me on this last journey; but this reflection,
far from discouraging me in my projected enterprise, produced the
contrary effect, as I called to <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>mind that, ever since the Lord
revealed Himself to man, it has seemed good to Him to accomplish
the greatest ends by apparently the most insufficient means; and
I reflected that this one copy might serve as an instrument for
more good than the four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
copies of the edition of Madrid.</p>
<p>I was aware that my own horses were quite incompetent to reach
Finisterre, as the roads or paths lie through stony ravines, and
over rough and shaggy hills, and therefore determined to leave
them behind with Antonio, whom I was unwilling to expose to the
fatigues of such a journey.&nbsp; I lost no time in sending for
an <i>alquilador</i>, or person who lets out horses, and
informing him of my intention.&nbsp; He said he had an excellent
mountain pony at my disposal, and that he himself would accompany
me; but at the same time observed, that it was a terrible journey
for man and horse, and that he expected to be paid
accordingly.&nbsp; I consented to give him what he demanded, but
on the express condition that he would perform his promise of
attending me himself, as I was unwilling to trust myself four or
five days amongst the hills with any low fellow of the town whom
he might select, and who it was very possible might play me some
evil turn.&nbsp; He replied by the term invariably used by the
Spaniards when they see doubt or distrust exhibited: &ldquo;<i>No
tenga usted cuidado</i>, <a name="citation2"></a><a
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a> I will go
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having thus arranged the matter perfectly
satisfactorily, as I thought, I partook of a slight supper, and
shortly afterwards retired to repose.</p>
<p>I had requested the <i>alquilador</i> to call me the next
morning at three o&rsquo;clock; he, however, did not make <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>his appearance
till five, having, I suppose, overslept himself, which was indeed
my own case.&nbsp; I arose in a hurry, dressed, put a few things
in a bag, not forgetting the Testament, which I had resolved to
present to the inhabitants of Finisterre.&nbsp; I then sallied
forth and saw my friend the <i>alquilador</i>, who was holding by
the bridle the pony or <i>jaca</i> which was destined to carry me
in my expedition.&nbsp; It was a beautiful little animal,
apparently strong and full of life, without one single white hair
in its whole body, which was black as the plumage of the
crow.</p>
<p>Behind it stood a strange-looking figure of the biped species,
to whom, however, at the moment, I paid little attention, but of
whom I shall have plenty to say in the sequel.</p>
<p>Having asked the horse-lender whether he was ready to proceed,
and being answered in the affirmative, I bade adieu to Antonio,
and putting the pony in motion, we hastened out of the town,
taking at first the road which leads towards Santiago.&nbsp;
Observing that the figure which I have previously alluded to was
following close at our heels, I asked the <i>alquilador</i> who
it was, and the reason of its following us; to which he replied
that it was a servant of his, who would proceed a little way with
us and then return.&nbsp; So on we went at a rapid rate, till we
were within a quarter of a mile of the Convent of the Esclavitud,
a little beyond which he had informed me that we should have to
turn off from the high-road; but here he suddenly stopped short,
and in a moment we were all at a standstill.&nbsp; I questioned
the guide as to the reason of this, but received no answer.&nbsp;
The fellow&rsquo;s eyes were directed to the ground, and he
seemed to be counting with the most intense solicitude the prints
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of the hoofs
of the oxen, mules, and horses in the dust of the road.&nbsp; I
repeated my demand in a louder voice; when, after a considerable
pause, he somewhat elevated his eyes, without, however, looking
me in the face, and said that he believed that I entertained the
idea that he himself was to guide me to Finisterre, which if I
did, he was very sorry for, the thing being quite impossible, as
he was perfectly ignorant of the way, and, moreover, incapable of
performing such a journey over rough and difficult ground, as he
was no longer the man he had been; and, over and above all that,
he was engaged that day to accompany a gentleman to Pontevedra,
who was at that moment expecting him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
continued he, &ldquo;as I am always desirous of behaving like a
<i>caballero</i> to everybody, I have taken measures to prevent
your being disappointed.&nbsp; This person,&rdquo; pointing to
the figure, &ldquo;I have engaged to accompany you.&nbsp; He is a
most trustworthy person, and is well acquainted with the route to
Finisterre, having been thither several times with this very
<i>jaca</i> on which you are mounted.&nbsp; He will, besides, be
an agreeable companion to you on the way, as he speaks French and
English very well, and has been all over the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The fellow ceased speaking at last; and I was so struck with his
craft, impudence, and villany, that some time elapsed before I
could find an answer.&nbsp; I then reproached him in the
bitterest terms for his breach of promise, and said that I was
much tempted to return to the town instantly, complain of him to
the <i>alcalde</i>, and have him punished at any expense.&nbsp;
To which he replied, &ldquo;Sir Cavalier, by so doing you will be
nothing nearer Finisterre, to which you seem so eager to
get.&nbsp; Take my advice, spur on the <i>jaca</i>, for you see
it is getting late, and it <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>is twelve long leagues from hence to
Corcuvion, where you must pass the night; and from thence to
Finisterre is no trifle.&nbsp; As for the man, <i>no tenga usted
cuidado</i>, he is the best guide in Galicia, speaks English and
French, and will bear you pleasant company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time I had reflected that by returning to Padron I
should indeed be only wasting time, and that by endeavouring to
have the fellow punished no benefit would accrue to me; moreover,
as he seemed to be a scoundrel in every sense of the word, I
might as well proceed in the company of any person as in
his.&nbsp; I therefore signified my intention of proceeding, and
told him to go back, in the Lord&rsquo;s name, and repent of his
sins.&nbsp; But having gained one point, he thought he had best
attempt another; so placing himself about a yard before the
<i>jaca</i>, he said that the price which I had agreed to pay him
for the loan of his horse (which, by-the-by, was the full sum he
had demanded) was by no means sufficient, and that before I
proceeded I must promise him two dollars more, adding that he was
either drunk or mad when he had made such a bargain.&nbsp; I was
now thoroughly incensed, and without a moment&rsquo;s reflection,
spurred the <i>jaca</i>, which flung him down in the dust, and
passed over him.&nbsp; Looking back at the distance of a hundred
yards, I saw him standing in the same place, his hat on the
ground, gazing after us, and crossing himself most
devoutly.&nbsp; His servant, or whatever he was, far from
offering any assistance to his principal, no sooner saw the
<i>jaca </i>in motion than he ran on by its side, without word or
comment, further than striking himself lustily on the thigh with
his right palm.&nbsp; We soon passed the Esclavitud, and
presently afterwards turned to the left into a stony broken path
leading to fields of maize.&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>We passed by several farm-houses, and
at last arrived at a dingle, the sides of which were plentifully
overgrown with dwarf oaks, and which slanted down to a small dark
river shaded with trees, which we crossed by a rude bridge.&nbsp;
By this time I had had sufficient time to scan my odd companion
from head to foot.&nbsp; His utmost height, had he made the most
of himself, might perhaps have amounted to five feet one inch;
but he seemed somewhat inclined to stoop.&nbsp; Nature had gifted
him with an immense head, and placed it clean upon his shoulders,
for amongst the items of his composition it did not appear that a
neck had been included.&nbsp; Arms long and brawny swung at his
sides, and the whole of his frame was as strong built and
powerful as a wrestler&rsquo;s; his body was supported by a pair
of short but very nimble legs.&nbsp; His face was very long, and
would have borne some slight resemblance to a human countenance
had the nose been more visible, for its place seemed to have been
entirely occupied by a wry mouth and large staring eyes.&nbsp;
His dress consisted of three articles: an old and tattered hat of
the Portuguese kind, broad at the crown and narrow at the eaves,
something which appeared to be a shirt, and dirty canvas
trousers.&nbsp; Willing to enter into conversation with him, and
remembering that the <i>alquilador</i> had informed me that he
spoke languages, I asked him, in English, if he had always acted
in the capacity of guide.&nbsp; Whereupon he turned his eyes with
a singular expression upon my face, gave a loud laugh, a long
leap, and clapped his hands thrice above his head.&nbsp;
Perceiving that he did not understand me, I repeated my demand in
French, and was again answered by the laugh, leap, and
clapping.&nbsp; At last he said, in broken Spanish, <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>&ldquo;Master
mine, speak Spanish in God&rsquo;s name, and I can understand
you, and still better if you speak Gallegan, but I can promise no
more.&nbsp; I heard what the <i>alquilador</i> told you, but he
is the greatest <i>embustero</i> in the whole land, and deceived
you then as he did when he promised to accompany you.&nbsp; I
serve him for my sins; but it was an evil hour when I left the
deep sea and turned guide.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then informed me that
he was a native of Padron, and a mariner by profession, having
spent the greater part of his life in the Spanish navy, in which
service he had visited Cuba and many parts of the Spanish
Americas, adding, &ldquo;when my master told you that I should
bear you pleasant company by the way, it was the only word of
truth that has come from his mouth for a month; and long before
you reach Finisterre you will have rejoiced that the servant, and
not the master, went with you: he is dull and heavy, but I am
what you see.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then gave two or three first-rate
somersaults, again laughed loudly, and clapped his hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would scarcely think,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that
I drove that little pony yesterday, heavily laden, all the way
from Corunna.&nbsp; We arrived at Padron at two o&rsquo;clock
this morning; but we are nevertheless both willing and able to
undertake a fresh journey.&nbsp; <i>No tenga usted cuidado</i>,
as my master said, no one ever complains of that pony or of
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this kind of discourse we proceeded a
considerable way through a very picturesque country, until we
reached a beautiful village at the skirt of a mountain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This village,&rdquo; said my guide, &ldquo;is called Los
Angeles, because its church was built long since by the angels;
they placed a beam of gold beneath it, which they brought down
from heaven, and which was once a rafter of God&rsquo;s <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>own
house.&nbsp; It runs all the way under the ground from hence to
the cathedral of Compostella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing through the village, which he likewise informed me
possessed baths, and was much visited by the people of Santiago,
we shaped our course to the north-west, and by so doing doubled a
mountain which rose majestically over our heads, its top crowned
with bare and broken rocks, whilst on our right, on the other
side of a spacious valley, was a high range connected with the
mountains to the northward of Saint James.&nbsp; On the summit of
this range rose high embattled towers, which my guide informed me
were those of Altamira, an ancient and ruined castle, formerly
the principal residence in this province of the counts of that
name.&nbsp; Turning now due west, we were soon at the bottom of a
steep and rugged pass, which led to more elevated regions.&nbsp;
The ascent cost us nearly half an hour, and the difficulties of
the ground were such that I more than once congratulated myself
on having left my own horses behind, and being mounted on the
gallant little pony, which, accustomed to such paths, scrambled
bravely forward, and eventually brought us in safety to the top
of the ascent.</p>
<p>Here we entered a Gallegan cabin, or <i>choza</i>, for the
purpose of refreshing the animal and ourselves.&nbsp; The
quadruped ate some maize, whilst we two bipeds regaled ourselves
on some <i>broa</i> and <i>aguardiente</i>, which a woman whom we
found in the hut placed before us.&nbsp; I walked out for a few
minutes to observe the aspect of the country, and on my return
found my guide fast asleep on the bench where I had left
him.&nbsp; He sat bolt upright, his back supported against the
wall, and his legs pendulous, within three inches of the ground,
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>being too
short to reach it.&nbsp; I remained gazing upon him for at least
five minutes, whilst he enjoyed slumbers seemingly as quiet and
profound as those of death itself.&nbsp; His face brought
powerfully to my mind some of those uncouth visages of saints and
abbots which are occasionally seen in the niches of the walls of
ruined convents.&nbsp; There was not the slightest gleam of
vitality in his countenance, which for colour and rigidity might
have been of stone, and which was as rude and battered as one of
the stone heads at Icolmkill, which have braved the winds of
twelve hundred years.&nbsp; I continued gazing on his face till I
became almost alarmed, concluding that life might have departed
from its harassed and fatigued tenement.&nbsp; On my shaking him
rather roughly by the shoulder he slowly awoke, opening his eyes
with a stare, and then closing them again.&nbsp; For a few
moments he was evidently unconscious of where he was.&nbsp; On my
shouting to him, however, and inquiring whether he intended to
sleep all day, instead of conducting me to Finisterre, he dropped
upon his legs, snatched up his hat, which lay on the table, and
instantly ran out of the door, exclaiming, &ldquo;Yes, yes, I
remember; follow me, captain, and I will lead you to Finisterre
in no time.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked after him, and perceived that
he was hurrying at a considerable pace in the direction in which
we had hitherto been proceeding.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;stop! will you leave me here with the pony?&nbsp; Stop;
we have not paid the reckoning.&nbsp; Stop!&rdquo;&nbsp; He,
however, never turned his head for a moment, and in less than a
minute was out of sight.&nbsp; The pony, which was tied to a crib
at one end of the cabin, began now to neigh terrifically, to
plunge, and to erect its tail and mane in a most singular
manner.&nbsp; It tore and strained at <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the halter till I was apprehensive
that strangulation would ensue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; I
exclaimed, &ldquo;where are you, and what is the meaning of all
this?&rdquo;&nbsp; But the hostess had likewise disappeared, and
though I ran about the <i>choza</i>, shouting myself hoarse, no
answer was returned.&nbsp; The pony still continued to scream and
to strain at the halter more violently than ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am
I beset with lunatics?&rdquo; I cried, and flinging down a
<i>peseta</i> on the table, unloosed the halter, and attempted to
introduce the bit into the mouth of the animal.&nbsp; This,
however, I found impossible to effect.&nbsp; Released from the
halter, the pony made at once for the door, in spite of all the
efforts which I could make to detain it.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
abandon me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am in a pretty situation; but
there is a remedy for everything!&rdquo; with which words I
sprang into the saddle, and in a moment more the creature was
bearing me at a rapid gallop in the direction, as I supposed, of
Finisterre.&nbsp; My position, however diverting to the reader,
was rather critical to myself.&nbsp; I was on the back of a
spirited animal, over which I had no control, dashing along a
dangerous and unknown path.&nbsp; I could not discover the
slightest vestige of my guide, nor did I pass any one from whom I
could derive any information.&nbsp; Indeed, the speed of the
animal was so great, that even in the event of my meeting or
overtaking a passenger, I could scarcely have hoped to exchange a
word with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is the pony trained to this
work?&rdquo; said I, mentally.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he carrying me to
some den of banditti, where my throat will be cut, or does he
follow his master by instinct?&rdquo;&nbsp; Both of these
suspicions I, however, soon abandoned.&nbsp; The pony&rsquo;s
speed relaxed; he appeared to have lost the road.&nbsp; He looked
about uneasily: at last, coming to a sandy <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>spot, he put
his nostrils to the ground, and then suddenly flung himself down,
and wallowed in true pony fashion.&nbsp; I was not hurt, and
instantly made use of this opportunity to slip the bit into his
mouth, which previously had been dangling beneath his neck; I
then remounted in quest of the road.</p>
<p>This I soon found, and continued my way for a considerable
time.&nbsp; The path lay over a moor, patched with heath and
furze, and here and there strewn with large stones, or rather
rocks.&nbsp; The sun had risen high in the firmament, and burned
fiercely.&nbsp; I passed several people, men and women, who gazed
at me with surprise, wondering, probably, what a person of my
appearance could be about, without a guide, in so strange a
place.&nbsp; I inquired of two females whom I met whether they
had seen my guide; but they either did not or would not
understand me, and, exchanging a few words with each other in one
of the hundred dialects of the Gallegan, passed on.&nbsp; Having
crossed the moor, I came rather abruptly upon a convent,
overhanging a deep ravine, at the bottom of which brawled a rapid
stream.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful and picturesque spot: the sides of the
ravine were thickly clothed with wood, and on the other side a
tall black hill uplifted itself.&nbsp; The edifice was large, and
apparently deserted.&nbsp; Passing by it, I presently reached a
small village, as deserted, to all appearance, as the convent,
for I saw not a single individual, nor so much as a dog to
welcome me with his bark.&nbsp; I proceeded, however, until I
reached a fountain, the waters of which gushed from a stone
pillar into a trough.&nbsp; Seated upon this last, his arms
folded, and his eyes fixed upon the neighbouring mountain, I
beheld a figure which still frequently recurs <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>to my
thoughts, especially when asleep and oppressed by the
nightmare.&nbsp; This figure was my runaway guide.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Good day to you, my gentleman.&nbsp; The
weather is hot, and yonder water appears delicious.&nbsp; I am
almost tempted to dismount and regale myself with a slight
draught.</p>
<p><i>Guide</i>.&mdash;Your worship can do no better.&nbsp; The
day is, as you say, hot; you can do no better than drink a little
of this water.&nbsp; I have myself just drunk.&nbsp; I would not,
however, advise you to give that pony any; it appears heated and
blown.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;It may well be so.&nbsp; I have been
galloping at least two leagues in pursuit of a fellow who engaged
to guide me to Finisterre, but who deserted me in a most singular
manner; so much so, that I almost believe him to be a thief, and
no true man.&nbsp; You do not happen to have seen him?</p>
<p><i>Guide</i>.&mdash;What kind of a man might he be?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;A short, thick fellow, very much like
yourself, with a hump upon his back, and, excuse me, of a very
ill-favoured countenance.</p>
<p><i>Guide</i>.&mdash;Ha, ha!&nbsp; I know him.&nbsp; He ran
with me to this fountain, where he has just left me.&nbsp; That
man, Sir Cavalier, is no thief.&nbsp; If he is anything at all,
he is a <i>Nuveiro</i> <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&mdash;a fellow who
rides upon the clouds, and is occasionally whisked away by a gust
of wind.&nbsp; Should you ever travel with that man again, never
allow him more than one glass of anise at a time, or he will
infallibly mount into the clouds and leave you, and then he will
ride and run till he comes to a water-brook, or knocks his head
against a fountain&mdash;<a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>then one draught, and he is himself
again.&nbsp; So you are going to Finisterre, Sir Cavalier.&nbsp;
Now it is singular enough, that a cavalier much of your
appearance engaged me to conduct him there this morning; I,
however, lost him on the way; so it appears to me our best plan
to travel together until you find your own guide and I find my
own master.</p>
<p>It might be about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon that we
reached a long and ruinous bridge, seemingly of great antiquity,
and which, as I was informed by my guide, was called the bridge
of Don Alonzo.&nbsp; It crossed a species of creek, or rather
frith, for the sea was at no considerable distance, and the small
town of Noyo lay at our right.&nbsp; &ldquo;When we have crossed
that bridge, captain,&rdquo; said my guide, &ldquo;we shall be in
an unknown country, for I have never been farther than Noyo, and
as for Finisterre, so far from having been there, I never heard
of such a place; and though I have inquired of two or three
people since we have been upon this expedition, they know as
little about it as I do.&nbsp; Taking all things, however, into
consideration, it appears to me that the best thing we can do is
to push forward to Corcuvion, which is five mad leagues from
hence, and which we may perhaps reach ere nightfall, if we can
find the way or get any one to direct us; for, as I told you
before, I know nothing about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To fine
hands have I confided myself,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;however, we
had best, as you say, push forward to Corcuvion, where,
peradventure, we may hear something of Finisterre, and find a
guide to conduct us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon, with a hop, skip,
and a jump, he again set forward at a rapid pace, stopping
occasionally at a <i>choza</i>, for the purpose, I suppose, of
making inquiries, though I understood scarcely anything of the <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>jargon in
which he addressed the people, and in which they answered
him.</p>
<p>We were soon in an extremely wild and hilly country,
scrambling up and down ravines, wading brooks, and scratching our
hands and faces with brambles, on which grew a plentiful crop of
wild mulberries, to gather some of which we occasionally made a
stop.&nbsp; Owing to the roughness of the way, we made no great
progress.&nbsp; The pony followed close at the back of the guide,
so near, indeed, that its nose almost touched his shoulder.&nbsp;
The country grew wilder and wilder, and, since we had passed a
water-mill, we had lost all trace of human habitation.&nbsp; The
mill stood at the bottom of a valley shaded by large trees, and
its wheels were turning with a dismal and monotonous noise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think we shall reach Corcuvion tonight?&rdquo; said
I to the guide, as we emerged from this valley to a savage moor,
which appeared of almost boundless extent.</p>
<p><i>Guide</i>.&mdash;I do not, I do not.&nbsp; We shall in no
manner reach Corcuvion to-night, and I by no means like the
appearance of this moor.&nbsp; The sun is rapidly sinking, and
then, if there come on a haze, we shall meet the
<i>Estad&eacute;a</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What do you mean by the
<i>Estad&eacute;a</i>?</p>
<p><i>Guide</i>.&mdash;What do I mean by the
<i>Estad&eacute;a</i>?&nbsp; My master asks me what I mean by the
<i>Estadinha</i>. <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> I have met the <i>Estadinha</i> but
once, and it was upon a moor something like this.&nbsp; I was in
company with several women, and a thick haze came on, and
suddenly a thousand lights shone above our heads in the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>haze, and
there was a wild cry, and the women fell to the ground screaming,
&lsquo;<i>Estad&eacute;a</i>!&nbsp; <i>Estad&eacute;a</i>!&rsquo;
and I myself fell to the ground crying out,
&lsquo;<i>Estadinha</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; The <i>Estad&eacute;a</i>
are the spirits of the dead which ride upon the haze, bearing
candles in their hands.&nbsp; I tell you frankly, my master, that
if we meet the assembly of the souls, I shall leave you at once,
and then I shall run and run till I drown myself in the sea,
somewhere about Muros.&nbsp; We shall not reach Corcuvion this
night; my only hope is that we may find some <i>choza</i> upon
these moors, where we may hide our heads from the
<i>Estadinha</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night overtook us ere we had traversed the moor; there
was, however, no haze, to the great joy of my guide, and a corner
of the moon partially illumined our steps.&nbsp; Our situation,
however, was dreary enough: we were upon the wildest heath of the
wildest province of Spain, ignorant of our way, and directing our
course we scarcely knew whither, for my guide repeatedly declared
to me that he did not believe that such a place as Finisterre
existed, or if it did exist, it was some bleak mountain pointed
out in a map.&nbsp; When I reflected on the character of this
guide, I derived but little comfort or encouragement: he was at
best evidently half-witted, and was by his own confession
occasionally seized with paroxysms which differed from madness in
no essential respect; his wild escapade in the morning of nearly
three leagues, without any apparent cause, and lastly his
superstitious and frantic fears of meeting the souls of the dead
upon this heath, in which event he intended, as he himself said,
to desert me and make for the sea, operated rather powerfully
upon my nerves.&nbsp; I likewise considered that it was quite
possible that we <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>might be in the route neither of Finisterre nor
Corcuvion, and I therefore determined to enter the first cabin at
which we should arrive, in preference to running the risk of
breaking our necks by tumbling down some pit or precipice.&nbsp;
No cabin, however, appeared in sight: the moor seemed
interminable, and we wandered on until the moon disappeared, and
we were left in almost total darkness.</p>
<p>At length we arrived at the foot of a steep ascent, up which a
rough and broken pathway appeared to lead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can this
be our way?&rdquo; said I to the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There appears to be no other for us, captain,&rdquo;
replied the man; &ldquo;let us ascend it by all means, and when
we are at the top, if the sea be in the neighbourhood we shall
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then dismounted, for to ride up such a pass in such darkness
would have been madness.&nbsp; We clambered up in a line, first
the guide, next the pony, with his nose as usual on his
master&rsquo;s shoulder, of whom he seemed passionately fond, and
I bringing up the rear, with my left hand grasping the
animal&rsquo;s tail.&nbsp; We had many a stumble, and more than
one fall: once, indeed, we were all rolling down the side of the
hill together.&nbsp; In about twenty minutes we reached the
summit, and looked around us, but no sea was visible: a black
moor, indistinctly seen, seemed to spread on every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to take up our quarters here till
morning,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Suddenly my guide seized me by the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
<i>l&uacute;me</i>, <i>senhor</i>,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;there
is <i>l&uacute;me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked in the direction in
which he pointed, and after straining my eyes for some time,
imagined that I perceived, far below and at some distance, a
faint glow.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span><i>l&uacute;me</i>,&rdquo; shouted
the guide, &ldquo;and it proceeds from the chimney of a
<i>choza</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On descending the eminence, we roamed about for a considerable
time, until we at last found ourselves in the midst of about six
or eight black huts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knock at the door of one of
these,&rdquo; said I to the guide, &ldquo;and inquire of the
people whether they can shelter us for the night.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
did so, and a man presently made his appearance, bearing in his
hand a lighted firebrand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you shelter a <i>Cavalheiro</i> from the night and
the <i>Estad&eacute;a</i>?&rdquo; said my guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From both, I thank God,&rdquo; said the man, who was an
athletic figure, without shoes and stockings, and who, upon the
whole, put me much in mind of a Munster peasant from the
bogs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray enter, gentlemen, we can accommodate you
both and your <i>cavalgadura</i> besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered the <i>choza</i>, which consisted of three
compartments; in the first we found straw, in the second cattle
and ponies, and in the third the family, consisting of the father
and mother of the man who admitted us, and his wife and
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a Catalan, sir Cavalier, and are going to your
countrymen at Corcuvion,&rdquo; said the man in tolerable
Spanish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you are brave people, you Catalans, and
fine establishments you have on the Gallegan shores; pity that
you take all the money out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, under all circumstances, I had not the slightest
objection to pass for a Catalan; and I rather rejoiced that these
wild people should suppose that I had powerful friends and
countrymen in the neighbourhood who were, perhaps, expecting
me.&nbsp; I therefore favoured <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>their mistake, and began with a harsh
Catalan accent to talk of the fish of Galicia, and the high
duties on salt.&nbsp; The eye of my guide was upon me for an
instant, with a singular expression, half serious, half droll;
he, however, said nothing, but slapped his thigh as usual, and
with a spring nearly touched the roof of the cabin with his
grotesque head.&nbsp; Upon inquiry, I discovered that we were
still two long leagues distant from Corcuvion, and that the road
lay over moor and hill, and was hard to find.&nbsp; Our host now
demanded whether we were hungry, and, upon being answered in the
affirmative, produced about a dozen eggs and some bacon.&nbsp;
Whilst our supper was cooking, a long conversation ensued between
my guide and the family, but as it was carried on in Gallegan, I
tried in vain to understand it.&nbsp; I believe, however, that it
principally related to witches and witchcraft, as the
<i>Estad&eacute;a</i> was frequently mentioned.&nbsp; After
supper I demanded where I could rest: whereupon the host pointed
to a trapdoor in the roof, saying that above there was a loft
where I could sleep by myself, and have clean straw.&nbsp; For
curiosity&rsquo;s sake, I asked whether there was such a thing as
a bed in the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;nor nearer than
Corcuvion.&nbsp; I never entered one in my life, nor any one of
my family; we sleep around the hearth, or among the straw with
the cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was too old a traveller to complain, but forthwith ascended
by a ladder into a species of loft, tolerably large and nearly
empty, where I placed my cloak beneath my head, and lay down on
the boards, which I preferred to the straw, for more reasons than
one.&nbsp; I heard the people below talking in Gallegan for a
considerable time, and could see the gleams of the fire <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>through the
interstices of the floor.&nbsp; The voices, however, gradually
died away, the fire sank low and could no longer be
distinguished.&nbsp; I dozed, started, dozed again, and dropped
finally into a profound sleep, from which I was only roused by
the crowing of the second cock.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful autumnal morning when we left the
<i>choza</i> and pursued our way to Corcuvion.&nbsp; I satisfied
our host by presenting him with a couple of <i>pesetas</i>, and
he requested as a favour, that if on our return we passed that
way, and were overtaken by the night, we would again take up our
abode beneath his roof.&nbsp; This I promised, at the same time
determining to do my best to guard against the contingency; as
sleeping in the loft of a Gallegan hut, though preferable to
passing the night on a moor or mountain, is anything but
desirable.</p>
<p>So we again started at a rapid pace along rough bridle-ways
and footpaths, amidst furze and brushwood.&nbsp; In about an hour
we obtained a view of the sea, and, directed by a lad whom we
found on the moor employed in tending a few miserable sheep, we
bent our course to the north-west, and at length reached the brow
of an eminence, where we stopped for some time to survey the
prospect before us.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>It was
not without reason that the Latins gave the name of <i>Finis
terr&aelig;</i> to this district.&nbsp; We had arrived exactly at
such a place as in my boyhood I had pictured to myself as the
termination of the world, beyond which there was a wild sea, or
abyss, or chaos.&nbsp; I now saw far before me an immense ocean,
and below me a long and irregular line of lofty and precipitous
coast.&nbsp; Certainly in the whole world there is no bolder
coast than the Gallegan shore, from the debouchement of the Minho
to Cape Finisterre.&nbsp; It consists of a granite wall of savage
mountains, for the most part serrated at the top, and
occasionally broken, where bays and firths like those of Vigo and
Pontevedra intervene, running deep into the land.&nbsp; These
bays and firths are invariably of an immense depth, and
sufficiently capacious to shelter the navies of the proudest
maritime nations.</p>
<p>There is an air of stern and savage grandeur in everything
around, which strongly captivates the imagination.&nbsp; This
savage coast is the first glimpse of Spain which the voyager from
the north catches, or he who has ploughed his way across the wide
Atlantic: and well does it seem to realize all his visions of
this strange land.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he exclaims,
&ldquo;this is indeed Spain&mdash;stern, flinty Spain&mdash;land
emblematic of those spirits to which she has given birth.&nbsp;
From what land but that before me could have proceeded those
portentous beings who astounded the Old World and filled the New
with horror and blood.&nbsp; Alva and Philip, Cortez and
Pizarro&mdash;stern colossal spectres looming through the gloom
of bygone years, like yonder granite mountains through the haze,
upon the eye of the mariner.&nbsp; Yes, yonder is indeed Spain;
flinty, indomitable Spain; land emblematic of its
sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>As for
myself, when I viewed that wide ocean and its savage shore, I
cried, &ldquo;Such is the grave, and such are its terrific sides;
those moors and wilds, over which I have passed, are the rough
and dreary journey of life.&nbsp; Cheered with hope, we struggle
along through all the difficulties of moor, bog, and mountain, to
arrive at&mdash;what?&nbsp; The grave and its dreary sides.&nbsp;
Oh, may hope not desert us in the last hour&mdash;hope in the
Redeemer and in God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We descended from the eminence, and again lost sight of the
sea amidst ravines and dingles, amongst which patches of pine
were occasionally seen.&nbsp; Continuing to descend, we at last
came, not to the sea, but to the extremity of a long narrow
firth, where stood a village or hamlet; whilst at a small
distance, on the western side of the firth, appeared one
considerably larger, which was indeed almost entitled to the
appellation of town.&nbsp; This last was Corcuvion; the first, if
I forget not, was called Ria de Silla.&nbsp; We hastened on to
Corcuvion, where I bade my guide make inquiries respecting
Finisterre.&nbsp; He entered the door of a wine-house, from which
proceeded much noise and vociferation, and presently returned,
informing me that the village of Finisterre was distant about a
league and a half.&nbsp; A man, evidently in a state of
intoxication, followed him to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
bound for Finisterre, <i>Cavalheiros</i>?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my friend,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;we are going
thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are going amongst a <i>fato de
borrachos</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a> he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take care that they do not play you a trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>We
passed on, and, striking across a sandy peninsula at the back of
the town, soon reached the shore of an immense bay, the
north-westernmost end of which was formed by the far-famed cape
of Finisterre, which we now saw before us stretching far into the
sea.</p>
<p>Along a beach of dazzling white sand we advanced towards the
cape, the bourne of our journey.&nbsp; The sun was shining
brightly, and every object was illumined by his beams.&nbsp; The
sea lay before us like a vast mirror, and the waves which broke
upon the shore were so tiny as scarcely to produce a
murmur.&nbsp; On we sped along the deep winding bay, overhung by
gigantic hills and mountains.&nbsp; Strange recollections began
to throng upon my mind.&nbsp; It was upon this beach that,
according to the tradition of all ancient Christendom, Saint
James, the patron saint of Spain, preached the Gospel to the
heathen Spaniards.&nbsp; Upon this beach had once stood an
immense commercial city, the proudest in all Spain.&nbsp; This
now desolate bay had once resounded with the voices of myriads,
when the keels and commerce of all the then known world were
wafted to Duyo. <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the name of this village?&rdquo; said I to a
woman, as we passed by five or six ruinous houses at the bend of
the bay, ere we entered upon the peninsula of Finisterre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no village,&rdquo; said the Gallegan,
&ldquo;this is no village, Sir Cavalier; this is a city, this is
Duyo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for the glory of the world!&nbsp; These huts were all
that the roaring sea and the tooth of time had left of Duyo, the
great city!&nbsp; Onward now to Finisterre.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>It was
mid-day when we reached the village of Finisterre, consisting of
about one hundred houses, and built on the southern side of the
peninsula, just before it rises into the huge bluff head which is
called the Cape.&nbsp; We sought in vain for an inn or
<i>venta</i>, where we might stable our beast; at one moment we
thought that we had found one, and had even tied the animal to
the manger.&nbsp; Upon our going out, however, he was instantly
untied and driven forth into the street.&nbsp; The few people
whom we saw appeared to gaze upon us in a singular manner.&nbsp;
We, however, took little notice of these circumstances, and
proceeded along the straggling street until we found shelter in
the house of a Castilian shopkeeper, whom some chance had brought
to this corner of Galicia&mdash;this end of the world.&nbsp; Our
first care was to feed the animal, who now began to exhibit
considerable symptoms of fatigue.&nbsp; We then requested some
refreshment for ourselves; and in about an hour, a tolerably
savoury fish, weighing about three pounds, and fresh from the
bay, was prepared for us by an old woman who appeared to
officiate as housekeeper.&nbsp; Having finished our meal, I and
my uncouth companion went forth, and prepared to ascend the
mountain.</p>
<p>We stopped to examine a small dismantled fort or battery
facing the bay, and, whilst engaged in this examination, it more
than once occurred to me that we were ourselves the objects of
scrutiny and investigation; indeed, I caught a glimpse of more
than one countenance peering upon us through the holes and chasms
of the walls.&nbsp; We now commenced ascending Finisterre; and,
making numerous and long <i>d&eacute;tours</i>, we wound our way
up its flinty sides.&nbsp; The sun had reached the top of heaven,
whence he showered upon <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>us perpendicularly his brightest and
fiercest rays.&nbsp; My boots were torn, my feet cut, and the
perspiration streamed from my brow.&nbsp; To my guide, however,
the ascent appeared to be neither toilsome nor difficult.&nbsp;
The heat of the day for him had no terrors, no moisture was wrung
from his tanned countenance; he drew not one short breath; and
hopped upon the stones and rocks with all the provoking agility
of a mountain goat.&nbsp; Before we had accomplished one-half of
the ascent, I felt myself quite exhausted.&nbsp; I reeled and
staggered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cheer up, master mine; be of good cheer,
and have no care,&rdquo; said the guide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yonder I
see a wall of stones; lie down beneath it in the
shade.&rdquo;&nbsp; He put his long and strong arm round my
waist, and, though his stature compared with mine was that of a
dwarf, he supported me as if I had been a child to a rude wall
which seemed to traverse the greater part of the hill, and served
probably as a kind of boundary.&nbsp; It was difficult to find a
shady spot: at last he perceived a small chasm, perhaps scooped
by some shepherd as a couch in which to enjoy his
<i>siesta</i>.&nbsp; In this he laid me gently down, and, taking
off his enormous hat, commenced fanning me with great
assiduity.&nbsp; By degrees I revived, and, after having rested
for a considerable time, I again attempted the ascent, which,
with the assistance of my guide, I at length accomplished.</p>
<p>We were now standing at a great altitude between two bays, the
wilderness of waters before us.&nbsp; Of all the ten thousand
barks which annually plough those seas in sight of that old cape,
not one was to be descried.&nbsp; It was a blue shiny waste,
broken by no object save the black head of a spermaceti whale,
which would occasionally show itself at the top, casting up <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>thin jets of
brine.&nbsp; The principal bay, that of Finisterre, as far as the
entrance, was beautifully variegated by an immense shoal of
<i>sardinhas</i>, on whose extreme skirts the monster was
probably feasting.&nbsp; From the other side of the cape we
looked down upon a smaller bay, the shore of which was overhung
by rocks of various and grotesque shapes; this is called the
outer bay, or, in the language of the country, <i>Praia do mar de
fora</i>: <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a> a fearful place in seasons of wind and
tempest, when the long swell of the Atlantic pouring in is broken
into surf and foam by the sunken rocks with which it
abounds.&nbsp; Even on the calmest day there is a rumbling and a
hollow roar in that bay which fill the heart with uneasy
sensations.</p>
<p>On all sides there was grandeur and sublimity.&nbsp; After
gazing from the summit of the cape for nearly an hour, we
descended.</p>
<p>On reaching the house where we had taken up our temporary
habitation, we perceived that the portal was occupied by several
men, some of whom were reclining on the floor drinking wine out
of small earthen pans, which are much used in this part of
Galicia.&nbsp; With a civil salutation I passed on, and ascended
the staircase to the room in which we had taken our repast.&nbsp;
Here there was a rude and dirty bed, on which I flung myself,
exhausted with fatigue.&nbsp; I determined to take a little
repose, and in the evening to call the people of the place
together, to read a few chapters of the Scripture, and then to
address them with a little Christian exhortation.&nbsp; I was
soon asleep, but my slumbers were by no means tranquil.&nbsp; I
thought I was surrounded with difficulties of various kinds,
amongst rocks and ravines, vainly endeavouring to <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>extricate
myself; uncouth visages showed themselves amidst the trees and in
the hollows, thrusting out cloven tongues, and uttering angry
cries.&nbsp; I looked around for my guide, but could not find
him; methought, however, that I heard his voice down a deep
dingle.&nbsp; He appeared to be talking of me.&nbsp; How long I
might have continued in these wild dreams I know not.&nbsp; I was
suddenly, however, seized roughly by the shoulder, and nearly
dragged from the bed.&nbsp; I looked up in amazement, and by the
light of the descending sun I beheld hanging over me a wild and
uncouth figure; it was that of an elderly man, built as strong as
a giant, with much beard and whisker, and huge bushy eyebrows,
dressed in the habiliments of a fisherman; in his hand was a
rusty musket.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Who are you, and what do you want?</p>
<p><i>Figure</i>.&mdash;Who I am matters but little.&nbsp; Get up
and follow me; it is you I want.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;By what authority do you thus presume to
interfere with me?</p>
<p><i>Figure</i>.&mdash;By the authority of the <i>justicia</i>
of Finisterre.&nbsp; Follow me peaceably, Calros, or it will be
the worse for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calros,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what does the person
mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought it, however, most prudent to obey
his command, and followed him down the staircase.&nbsp; The shop
and the portal were now thronged with the inhabitants of
Finisterre, men, women, and children; the latter for the most
part in a state of nudity, and with bodies wet and dripping,
having been probably summoned in haste from their gambols in the
brine.&nbsp; Through this crowd the figure whom I have attempted
to describe pushed his way with an air of authority.</p>
<p>On arriving in the street, he laid his heavy hand <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>upon my arm,
not roughly, however.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is Calros! it is
Calros!&rdquo; said a hundred voices; &ldquo;he has come to
Finisterre at last, and the <i>justicia</i> have now got hold of
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wondering what all this could mean, I attended
my strange conductor down the street.&nbsp; As we proceeded, the
crowd increased every moment, following and vociferating.&nbsp;
Even the sick were brought to the doors to obtain a view of what
was going forward, and a glance at the redoubtable Calros.&nbsp;
I was particularly struck by the eagerness displayed by one man,
a cripple, who, in spite of the entreaties of his wife, mixed
with the crowd, and having lost his crutch, hopped forward on one
leg, exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Carracho</i>! <i>tambien voy
yo</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>We at last reached a house of rather larger size than the
rest; my guide, having led me into a long low room, placed me in
the middle of the floor, and then hurrying to the door, he
endeavoured to repulse the crowd who strove to enter with
us.&nbsp; This he effected, though not without considerable
difficulty, being once or twice compelled to have recourse to the
butt of his musket to drive back unauthorized intruders.&nbsp; I
now looked round the room.&nbsp; It was rather scantily
furnished: I could see nothing but some tubs and barrels, the
mast of a boat, and a sail or two.&nbsp; Seated upon the tubs
were three or four men coarsely dressed, like fishermen or
shipwrights.&nbsp; The principal personage was a surly
ill-tempered looking fellow of about thirty-five, whom eventually
I discovered to be the <i>alcalde</i> of Finisterre, and lord of
the house in which we now were.&nbsp; In a corner I caught a
glimpse of my guide, who was evidently in durance, two stout
fishermen standing before him, one with a musket and the other <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>with a
boat-hook.&nbsp; After I had looked about me for a minute, the
<i>alcalde</i>, giving his whiskers a twist, thus addressed
me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, where is your passport, and what brings
you to Finisterre?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I am an Englishman.&nbsp; Here is my
passport, and I came to see Finisterre.</p>
<p>This reply seemed to discomfit them for a moment.&nbsp; They
looked at each other, then at my passport.&nbsp; At length the
<i>alcalde</i>, striking it with his finger, bellowed forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no Spanish passport; it appears to be written
in French.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I have already told you that I am a
foreigner.&nbsp; I of course carry a foreign passport.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;Then you mean to assert that you are not
<i>Calros Rey</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I never heard before of such a king, nor
indeed of such a name.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;Hark to the fellow! he has the audacity
to say that he has never heard of Calros the pretender, who calls
himself king.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;If you mean by Calros, the pretender Don
Carlos, all I can reply is, that you can scarcely be
serious.&nbsp; You might as well assert that yonder poor fellow,
my guide, whom I see you have made prisoner, is his nephew, the
<i>Infante</i> Don Sebastian. <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;See, you have betrayed yourself; that is
the very person we suppose him to be.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;It is true that they are both
hunchbacks.&nbsp; But how can I be like Don Carlos?&nbsp; I have
nothing the appearance of a Spaniard, and am nearly a foot taller
than the pretender.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;That makes no difference; you of
course carry many waistcoats about you, by means of which you
disguise yourself, and appear tall or low according to your
pleasure.</p>
<p>This last was so conclusive an argument that I had of course
nothing to reply to it.&nbsp; The <i>alcalde</i> looked around
him in triumph, as if he had made some notable discovery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, it is Calros; it is Calros,&rdquo; said the crowd at
the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be as well to have these men shot
instantly,&rdquo; continued the <i>alcalde</i>; &ldquo;if they
are not the two pretenders, they are at any rate two of the
factious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am by no means certain that they are either one or
the other,&rdquo; said a gruff voice.</p>
<p>The <i>justicia</i> of Finisterre turned their eyes in the
direction from which these words proceeded, and so did I.&nbsp;
Our glances rested upon the figure who held watch at the
door.&nbsp; He had planted the barrel of his musket on the floor,
and was now leaning his chin against the butt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am by no means certain that they are either one or
the other,&rdquo; repeated he, advancing forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have been examining this man,&rdquo; pointing to myself,
&ldquo;and listening whilst he spoke, and it appears to me that
after all he may prove an Englishman; he has their very look and
voice.&nbsp; Who knows the English better than Antonio de la
Trava, and who has a better right?&nbsp; Has he not sailed in
their ships; has he not eaten their biscuit; and did he not stand
by Nelson when he was shot dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the <i>alcalde</i> became violently incensed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is no more an Englishman than yourself,&rdquo; he
exclaimed; &ldquo;if he were an Englishman would he have come in
this manner, skulking across the land?&nbsp; Not so, I <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>trow.&nbsp;
He would have come in a ship, recommended to some of us, or to
the Catalans.&nbsp; He would have come to trade&mdash;to buy; but
nobody knows him in Finisterre, nor does he know anybody, and the
first thing, moreover, that he does when he reaches this place is
to inspect the fort, and to ascend the mountain, where, no doubt,
he has been marking out a camp.&nbsp; What brings him to
Finisterre, if he is neither Calros nor a <i>bribon</i> of a
<i>faccioso</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that there was a good deal of justice in some of these
remarks, and I was aware, for the first time, that I had indeed
committed a great imprudence in coming to this wild place, and
among these barbarous people, without being able to assign any
motive which could appear at all valid in their eyes.&nbsp; I
endeavoured to convince the <i>alcalde</i> that I had come across
the country for the purpose of making myself acquainted with the
many remarkable objects which it contained, and of obtaining
information respecting the character and condition of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; He could understand no such motives.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What did you ascend the mountain for?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To see prospects.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Disparate</i>!&nbsp; I have lived at Finisterre forty
years, and never ascended that mountain.&nbsp; I would not do it
in a day like this for two ounces of gold.&nbsp; You went to take
altitudes, and to mark out a camp.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had, however, a
staunch friend in old Antonio, who insisted, from his knowledge
of the English, that all I said might very possibly be
true.&nbsp; &ldquo;The English,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have more
money than they know what to do with, and on that account they
wander all over the world, paying dearly for what no other people
care a groat for.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then proceeded, notwithstanding
the frowns of the <i>alcalde</i>, to examine me in the English
language.&nbsp; His <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>own entire knowledge of this tongue was confined to two
words&mdash;<i>knife</i> and <i>fork</i>, which words I rendered
into Spanish by their equivalents, and was forthwith pronounced
an Englishman by the old fellow, who, brandishing his musket,
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is not Calros; he is what he declares himself
to be, an Englishman, and whosoever seeks to injure him shall
have to do with Antonio de la Trava, <i>el valiente de
Finisterra</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; No person sought to impugn this
verdict, and it was at length determined that I should be sent to
Corcuvion, to be examined by the <i>alcalde mayor</i> of the
district.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the <i>alcalde</i> of
Finisterre, &ldquo;what is to be done with the other
fellow?&nbsp; He at least is no Englishman.&nbsp; Bring him
forward, and let us hear what he has to say for himself.&nbsp;
Now, fellow, who are you, and what is your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Guide</i>.&mdash;I am Sebastianillo, a poor broken mariner
of Padron, and my master for the present is the gentleman whom
you see, the most valiant and wealthy of all the English.&nbsp;
He has two ships at Vigo laden with riches.&nbsp; I told you so
when you first seized me up there in our <i>posada</i>.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;Where is your passport?</p>
<p><i>Guide</i>.&mdash;I have no passport.&nbsp; Who would think
of bringing a passport to such a place as this, where I
don&rsquo;t suppose there are two individuals who can read?&nbsp;
I have no passport; my master&rsquo;s passport of course includes
me.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;It does not.&nbsp; And since you have no
passport, and have confessed that your name is Sebastian, you
shall be shot.&nbsp; Antonio de la Trava, do you and the
musketeers lead this Sebastianillo forth, and shoot him before
the door.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span><i>Antonio de la Trava</i>.&mdash;With much pleasure,
<i>Se&ntilde;or Alcalde</i>, since you order it.&nbsp; With
respect to this fellow, I shall not trouble myself to
interfere.&nbsp; He at least is no Englishman.&nbsp; He has more
the look of a wizard or <i>nuveiro</i>; one of those devils who
raise storms and sink launches.&nbsp; Moreover, he says he is
from Padron, and those of that place are all thieves and
drunkards.&nbsp; They once played me a trick, and I would gladly
be at the shooting of the whole <i>pueblo</i>.</p>
<p>I now interfered, and said that if they shot the guide they
must shoot me too; expatiating at the same time on the cruelty
and barbarity of taking away the life of a poor unfortunate
fellow who, as might be seen at the first glance, was only
half-witted; adding, moreover, that if any person was guilty in
this case it was myself, as the other could only be considered in
the light of a servant acting under my orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safest plan, after all,&rdquo; said the
<i>alcalde</i>, &ldquo;appears to be to send you both prisoners
to Corcuvion, where the head <i>alcalde</i> can dispose of you as
he thinks proper.&nbsp; You must, however, pay for your escort;
for it is not to be supposed that the housekeepers of Finisterre
have nothing else to do than to ramble about the country with
every chance fellow who finds his way to this town.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;As for that matter,&rdquo; said Antonio, &ldquo;I will
take charge of them both.&nbsp; I am the <i>valiente</i> of
Finisterre, and fear no two men living.&nbsp; Moreover, I am sure
that the captain here will make it worth my while, else he is no
Englishman.&nbsp; Therefore let us be quick, and set out for
Corcuvion at once, as it is getting late.&nbsp; First of all,
however, captain, I must search you and your baggage.&nbsp; You
have no arms, of course?&nbsp; But it is best to make all
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Long
ere it was dark I found myself again on the pony, in company with
my guide, wending our way along the beach in the direction of
Corcuvion.&nbsp; Antonio de la Trava tramped heavily on before,
his musket on his shoulder.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Are you not afraid, Antonio, to be thus
alone with two prisoners, one of whom is on horseback?&nbsp; If
we were to try, I think we could overpower you.</p>
<p><i>Antonio de la Trava</i>.&mdash;I am the <i>valiente de
Finisterra</i>, and I fear no odds.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Why do you call yourself the
<i>valiente</i> of Finisterre?</p>
<p><i>Antonio de la Trava</i>.&mdash;The whole district call me
so.&nbsp; When the French came to Finisterre and demolished the
fort, three perished by my hand.&nbsp; I stood on the mountain,
up where I saw you scrambling to-day.&nbsp; I continued firing at
the enemy, until three detached themselves in pursuit of
me.&nbsp; The fools! two perished amongst the rocks by the fire
of this musket, and as for the third, I beat his head to pieces
with the stock.&nbsp; It is on that account that they call me the
<i>valiente</i> of Finisterre.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;How came you to serve with the English
fleet?&nbsp; I think I heard you say that you were present when
Nelson fell.</p>
<p><i>Antonio de la Trava</i>.&mdash;I was captured by your
countrymen, captain; and as I had been a sailor from my
childhood, they were glad of my services.&nbsp; I was nine months
with them, and assisted at Trafalgar.&nbsp; I saw the English
admiral die.&nbsp; You have something of his face, and your
voice, when you spoke, sounded in my ears like his own.&nbsp; I
love the English, and on that account I saved you.&nbsp; Think
not that I would <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>toil along these sands with you if you were one of my
own countrymen.&nbsp; Here we are at Duyo, captain.&nbsp; Shall
we refresh?</p>
<p>We did refresh, or rather Antonio de la Trava refreshed,
swallowing pan after pan of wine, with a thirst which seemed
unquenchable.&nbsp; &ldquo;That man was a greater wizard than
myself,&rdquo; whispered Sebastian, my guide, &ldquo;who told us
that the drunkards of Finisterre would play us a
trick.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length the old hero of the Cape slowly
rose, saying that we must hasten on to Corcuvion, or the night
would overtake us by the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of person is the <i>alcalde</i> to whom you
are conducting me?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very different from him of Finisterre,&rdquo;
replied Antonio.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a young
<i>Se&ntilde;orito</i>, lately arrived from Madrid.&nbsp; He is
not even a Gallegan.&nbsp; He is a mighty liberal, and it is
owing chiefly to his orders that we have lately been so much on
the alert.&nbsp; It is said that the Carlists are meditating a
descent on these parts of Galicia.&nbsp; Let them only come to
Finisterre; we are liberals there to a man, and the old
<i>valiente</i> is ready to play the same part as in the time of
the French.&nbsp; But, as I was telling you before, the
<i>alcalde</i> to whom I am conducting you is a young man, and
very learned, and, if he thinks proper, he can speak English to
you, even better than myself, notwithstanding I was a friend of
Nelson, and fought by his side at Trafalgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was dark night before we reached Corcuvion.&nbsp; Antonio
again stopped to refresh at a wine-shop, after which he conducted
us to the house of the <i>alcalde</i>.&nbsp; His steps were by
this time not particularly steady, and on arriving at the gate of
the house, he stumbled <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>over the threshold and fell.&nbsp; He
got up with an oath, and instantly commenced thundering at the
door with the stock of his musket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
at length demanded a soft female voice in Gallegan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The <i>valiente</i> of Finisterre,&rdquo; replied Antonio;
whereupon the gate was unlocked, and we beheld before us a very
pretty female with a candle in her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;What brings
you here so late, Antonio?&rdquo; she inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
bring two prisoners, <i>mi pulida</i>,&rdquo; replied
Antonio.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Ave Maria</i>!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they will do no harm.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will answer for one,&rdquo; replied the old man;
&ldquo;but as for the other, he is a <i>nuveiro</i>, and has sunk
more ships than all his brethren in Galicia.&nbsp; But be not
afraid, my beauty,&rdquo; he continued, as the female made the
sign of the cross: &ldquo;first lock the gate, and then show me
the way to the <i>alcalde</i>.&nbsp; I have much to tell
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gate was locked, and bidding us stay below
in the court-yard, Antonio followed the young woman up a stone
stair, whilst we remained in darkness below.</p>
<p>After the lapse of about a quarter of an hour we again saw the
candle gleam upon the staircase, and the young female
appeared.&nbsp; Coming up to me, she advanced the candle to my
features, on which she gazed very intently.&nbsp; After a long
scrutiny she went to my guide, and having surveyed him still more
fixedly, she turned to me, and said, in her best Spanish,
&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Cavalier, I congratulate you on your
servant.&nbsp; He is the best-looking <i>mozo</i> in all
Galicia.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>! if he had but a coat to his back, and
did not go barefoot, I would accept him at once as a
<i>novio</i>; but I have unfortunately made a vow never to marry
a poor man, but only one who has got a heavy purse and can buy me
fine clothes.&nbsp; So you <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>are a Carlist, I suppose?&nbsp;
<i>Vaya</i>!&nbsp; I do not like you the worse for that.&nbsp;
But, being so, how went you to Finisterre, where they are all
<i>Cristinos</i> and <i>negros</i>?&nbsp; Why did you not go to
my village?&nbsp; None would have meddled with you there.&nbsp;
Those of my village are of a different stamp to the drunkards of
Finisterre.&nbsp; Those of my village never interfere with honest
people.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>! how I hate that drunkard of Finisterre
who brought you; he is so old and ugly; were it not for the love
which I bear to the <i>Se&ntilde;or Alcalde</i>, I would at once
unlock the gate and bid you go forth, you and your servant, <i>el
buen mozo</i>&rdquo;. <a name="citation37"></a><a
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a></p>
<p>Antonio now descended.&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;his worship the <i>alcalde</i> will be ready to receive
you in a moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sebastian and myself followed him
upstairs to a room, where, seated behind a table, we beheld a
young man of low stature, but handsome features, and very
fashionably dressed.&nbsp; He appeared to be inditing a letter,
which, when he had concluded, he delivered to a secretary to be
transcribed.&nbsp; He then looked at me for a moment fixedly, and
the following conversation ensued between us:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;I see that you are an Englishman, and my
friend Antonio here informs me that you have been arrested at
Finisterre.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;He tells you true; and but for him I
believe that I should have fallen by the hands of those savage
fishermen.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;The inhabitants of Finisterre are brave,
and are all liberals.&nbsp; Allow me to look at your
passport?&nbsp; Yes, all in form.&nbsp; Truly it was very
ridiculous that they should have arrested you as a Carlist.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Not only as a Carlist, but as Don
Carlos himself.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;Oh! most ridiculous; mistake a
countryman of the grand Baintham for such a Goth!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Excuse me, sir, you speak of the grand
somebody.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;The grand Baintham.&nbsp; He who has
invented laws for all the world.&nbsp; I hope shortly to see them
adopted in this unhappy country of ours.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Oh! you mean Jeremy Bentham.&nbsp; Yes! a
very remarkable man in his way.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;In his way! in all ways.&nbsp; The most
universal genius which the world ever produced:&mdash;a Solon, a
Plato, and a Lope de Vega.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I have never read his writings.&nbsp; I
have no doubt that he was a Solon; and as you say, a Plato.&nbsp;
I should scarcely have thought, however, that he could be ranked
as a poet with Lope de Vega.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;How surprising!&nbsp; I see, indeed,
that you know nothing of his writings, though an
Englishman.&nbsp; Now, here am I, a simple <i>alcalde</i> of
Galicia, yet I possess all the writings of Baintham on that
shelf, and I study them day and night.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;You doubtless, sir, possess the English
language.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;I do.&nbsp; I mean that part of it which
is contained in the writings of Baintham.&nbsp; I am most truly
glad to see a countryman of his in these Gothic
wildernesses.&nbsp; I understand and appreciate your motives for
visiting them: excuse the incivility and rudeness which you have
experienced.&nbsp; But we will endeavour to make you
reparation.&nbsp; You are this moment free: but it is late; I
must find you a lodging for the night.&nbsp; I know one close by
which will just suit you.&nbsp; Let us <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>repair thither this moment.&nbsp;
Stay, I think I see a book in your hand.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;The New Testament.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;What book is that?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;A portion of the sacred writings, the
Bible.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;Why do you carry such a book with
you?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;One of my principal motives in visiting
Finisterre was to carry this book to that wild place.</p>
<p><i>Alcalde</i>.&mdash;Ha, ha! how very singular.&nbsp; Yes, I
remember.&nbsp; I have heard that the English highly prize this
eccentric book.&nbsp; How very singular that the countrymen of
the grand Baintham should set any value upon that old monkish
book!</p>
<p>It was now late at night, and my new friend attended me to the
lodging which he had destined for me, and which was at the house
of a respectable old female, where I found a clean and
comfortable room.&nbsp; On the way I slipped a gratuity into the
hand of Antonio, and on my arrival, formally, and in the presence
of the <i>alcalde</i>, presented him with the Testament, which I
requested he would carry back to Finisterre, and keep in
remembrance of the Englishman in whose behalf he had so
effectually interposed.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;I will do so, your worship, and when the
winds blow from the north-west, preventing our launches from
putting to sea, I will read your present.&nbsp; Farewell, my
captain, and when you next come to Finisterre, I hope it will be
in a valiant English bark, with plenty of contraband on board,
and not across the country on a pony, in company with
<i>nuveiros</i> and men of Padron.</p>
<p>Presently arrived the handmaid of the <i>alcalde</i> with a
basket, which she took into the kitchen, where she prepared an
excellent supper for her master&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>On its being
served up the <i>alcalde</i> bade me farewell, having first
demanded whether he could in any way forward my plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I return to Saint James to-morrow,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;and I sincerely hope that some occasion will occur which
will enable me to acquaint the world with the hospitality which I
have experienced from so accomplished a scholar as the
<i>Alcalde</i> of Corcuvion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Corcuvion I returned to St. James and Corunna, and now
began to make preparation for directing my course to the
Asturias.&nbsp; In the first place I parted with my Andalusian
horse, which I considered unfit for the long and mountainous
journey I was about to undertake, his constitution having become
much debilitated from his Gallegan travels.&nbsp; Owing to horses
being exceedingly scarce at Corunna, I had no difficulty in
disposing of him at a far higher price than he originally cost
me.&nbsp; A young and wealthy merchant of Corunna, who was a
national guardsman, became enamoured of his glossy skin and long
mane and tail.&nbsp; For my own part, I was glad to part with him
for more reasons than one; he was both vicious and savage, and
was continually getting me into scrapes in the stables of the
<i>posadas</i> where we slept or baited.&nbsp; An old Castilian
peasant, whose pony he had maltreated, once said to me,
&ldquo;Sir Cavalier, if you have any love or respect for
yourself, get rid, I beseech you, of that beast, who is capable
of proving the ruin <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>of a kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I left him behind at
Corunna, where I subsequently learned that he became glandered
and died.&nbsp; Peace to his memory!</p>
<p>From Corunna I crossed the bay to Ferrol, whilst Antonio with
our remaining horse followed by land, a rather toilsome and
circuitous journey, although the distance by water is scarcely
three leagues.&nbsp; I was very sea-sick during the passage, and
lay almost senseless at the bottom of the small launch in which I
had embarked, and which was crowded with people.&nbsp; The wind
was adverse, and the water rough.&nbsp; We could make no sail,
but were impelled along by the oars of five or six stout
mariners, who sang all the while Gallegan ditties.&nbsp; Suddenly
the sea appeared to have become quite smooth, and my sickness at
once deserted me.&nbsp; I rose upon my feet and looked
around.&nbsp; We were in one of the strangest places
imaginable.&nbsp; A long and narrow passage overhung on either
side by a stupendous barrier of black and threatening
rocks.&nbsp; The line of the coast was here divided by a natural
cleft, yet so straight and regular that it seemed not the work of
chance but design.&nbsp; The water was dark and sullen, and of
immense depth.&nbsp; This passage, which is about a mile in
length, is the entrance to a broad basin, at whose farther
extremity stands the town of Ferrol.</p>
<p>Sadness came upon me as soon as I entered this place.&nbsp;
Grass was growing in the streets, and misery and distress stared
me in the face on every side.&nbsp; Ferrol is the grand naval
arsenal of Spain, and has shared in the ruin of the once splendid
Spanish navy: it is no longer thronged with those thousand
shipwrights who prepared for sea the tremendous three-deckers and
long frigates, the greater part of which <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>were
destroyed at Trafalgar.&nbsp; Only a few ill-paid and
half-starved workmen still linger about, scarcely sufficient to
repair any <i>guarda costa</i> <a name="citation43a"></a><a
href="#footnote43a" class="citation">[43a]</a> which may put in
dismantled by the fire of some English smuggling schooner from
Gibraltar.&nbsp; Half the inhabitants of Ferrol <a
name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a> beg their bread; and amongst these, as
it is said, are not unfrequently found retired naval officers,
many of them maimed or otherwise wounded, who are left to pine in
indigence: their pensions or salaries having been allowed to run
three or four years in arrear, owing to the exigencies of the
times.&nbsp; A crowd of importunate beggars followed me to the
<i>posada</i>, and even attempted to penetrate to the apartment
to which I was conducted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said I
to a woman who flung herself at my feet, and who bore in her
countenance evident marks of former gentility.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
widow, sir,&rdquo; she replied, in very good French; &ldquo;a
widow of a brave officer, once admiral of this port.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The misery and degradation of modern Spain are nowhere so
strikingly manifested as at Ferrol.</p>
<p>Yet even here there is still much to admire.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding its present state of desolation, it contains some
good streets, and abounds with handsome houses.&nbsp; <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>The
<i>alameda</i> is planted with nearly a thousand elms, of which
almost all are magnificent trees, and the poor Ferrolese, with
the genuine spirit of localism so prevalent in Spain, boast that
their town contains a better public walk than Madrid, of whose
<i>prado</i>, when they compare the two, they speak in terms of
unmitigated contempt.&nbsp; At one end of this <i>alameda</i>
stands the church, the only one in Ferrol.&nbsp; To this church I
repaired the day after my arrival, which was Sunday.&nbsp; I
found it quite insufficient to contain the number of worshippers
who, chiefly from the country, not only crowded the interior,
but, bareheaded, were upon their knees before the door to a
considerable distance down the walk.</p>
<p>Parallel with the <i>alameda</i> extends the wall of the naval
arsenal and dock.&nbsp; I spent several hours in walking about
these places, to visit which it is necessary to procure a written
permission from the captain-general of Ferrol.&nbsp; They filled
me with astonishment.&nbsp; I have seen the royal dock-yards of
Russia and England, but, for grandeur of design and costliness of
execution, they cannot for a moment compare with these wonderful
monuments of the bygone naval pomp of Spain.&nbsp; I shall not
attempt to describe them, but content myself with observing that
the oblong basin, which is surrounded with a granite mole, is
capacious enough to permit a hundred first-rates to lie
conveniently in ordinary: but instead of such a force, I saw only
a sixty-gun frigate and two brigs lying in this basin; and to
this inconsiderable number of vessels is the present war marine
of Spain reduced.</p>
<p>I waited for the arrival of Antonio two or three days at
Ferrol, and still he came not: late one evening, however, as I
was looking down the street, I <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>perceived him advancing, leading our
only horse by the bridle.&nbsp; He informed me that, at about
three leagues from Corunna, the heat of the weather and the flies
had so distressed the animal that it had fallen down in a kind of
fit, from which it had been only relieved by copious bleeding, on
which account he had been compelled to halt for a day upon the
road.&nbsp; The horse was evidently in a very feeble state; and
had a strange rattling in its throat, which alarmed me at
first.&nbsp; I, however, administered some remedies, and in a few
days deemed him sufficiently recovered to proceed.</p>
<p>We accordingly started from Ferrol, having first hired a pony
for myself, and a guide who was to attend us as far as Rivadeo,
<a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> twenty leagues from Ferrol, and on the
confines of the Asturias.&nbsp; The day at first was fine, but
ere we reached Novales, a distance of three leagues, the sky
became overcast, and a mist descended, accompanied by a drizzling
rain.&nbsp; The country through which we passed was very
picturesque.&nbsp; At about two in the afternoon we could descry
through the mist the small fishing-town of Santa Marta on our
left, with its beautiful bay.&nbsp; Travelling along the summit
of a line of hills, we presently entered a chestnut forest, which
appeared to be without limit: the rain still descended, and kept
up a ceaseless pattering among the broad green leaves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is the commencement of the autumnal rains,&rdquo;
said the guide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many is the wetting that you will
get, my masters, before you reach Oviedo.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you ever been as far as Oviedo?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and once
only to Rivadeo, the place to <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>which I am now conducting you, and I
tell you frankly that we shall soon be in wildernesses where the
way is hard to find, especially at night, and amidst rain and
waters.&nbsp; I wish I were fairly back to Ferrol, for I like not
this route, which is the worst in Galicia, in more respects than
one; but where my master&rsquo;s pony goes, there must I go too;
such is the life of us guides.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shrugged my
shoulders at this intelligence, which was by no means cheering,
but made no answer.&nbsp; At length, about nightfall, we emerged
from the forest, and presently descended into a deep valley at
the foot of lofty hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; I demanded of the guide, as we
crossed a rude bridge at the bottom of the valley, down which a
rivulet swollen by the rain foamed and roared.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
the valley of Coisa Doiro,&rdquo; <a name="citation46"></a><a
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a> he replied;
&ldquo;and it is my advice that we stay here for the night and do
not venture among those hills, through which lies the path to
Viveiro; for as soon as we get there, <i>adios</i>!&nbsp; I shall
be bewildered, which will prove the destruction of us
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there a village nigh?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, the village is right before us, and we shall be there
in a moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; We soon reached the village, which
stood amongst some tall trees at the entrance of a pass which led
up amongst the hills.&nbsp; Antonio dismounted, and entered two
or three of the cabins, but presently came to me, saying,
&ldquo;We cannot stay here, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, without
being devoured by vermin; we had better be amongst the hills than
in this place.&nbsp; There is neither fire nor light in these
cabins, and the rain is streaming through the roofs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The guide, however, refused to proceed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could
scarcely find my way amongst those hills by daylight,&rdquo; he
cried surlily, <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;much less at night, &rsquo;midst storm and
<i>bretima</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We procured some wine and maize
bread from one of the cottages.&nbsp; Whilst we were partaking of
these, Antonio said, &ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, the best
thing we can do in our present situation is to hire some fellow
of this village to conduct us through the hills to Viveiro.&nbsp;
There are no beds in this place, and if we lie down in the litter
in our damp clothes we shall catch a tertian of Galicia. <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; Our present guide is of no
service; we must therefore find another to do his
duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without waiting for a reply, he flung down the
crust of <i>broa</i> which he was munching and disappeared.&nbsp;
I subsequently learned that he went to the cottage of the
<i>alcalde</i>, and demanded, in the queen&rsquo;s name, a guide
for the Greek ambassador, who was benighted on his way to the
Asturias.&nbsp; In about ten minutes I again saw him, attended by
the local functionary, who, to my surprise, made me a profound
bow, and stood bare-headed in the rain.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
excellency,&rdquo; shouted Antonio, &ldquo;is in need of a guide
to Viveiro.&nbsp; People of our description are not compelled to
pay for any service which they may require; however, as his
excellency has bowels of compassion, he is willing to give three
<i>pesetas</i> to any competent person who will accompany him to
Viveiro, and as much bread and wine as he can eat and drink on
his arrival.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His excellency shall be
served,&rdquo; said the alcalde; &ldquo;however, as the way is
long and the path is bad, and there is much <i>bretima</i>
amongst the hills, it appears to me that, besides the bread and
wine, his excellency can do no less than offer four pesetas to
the guide who may be willing to accompany him to Viveiro; and I
know no one better than my own son-in-law, Juanito.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Content, <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span><i>Se&ntilde;or Alcalde</i>,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;produce the guide, and the extra <i>peseta</i> shall be
forthcoming in due season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon appeared Juanito with a lantern in his hand.&nbsp; We
instantly set forward.&nbsp; The two guides began conversing in
Gallegan.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said
Antonio, &ldquo;this new scoundrel is asking the old one what he
thinks we have got in our portmanteaus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
without awaiting my answer, he shouted, &ldquo;Pistols, ye
barbarians!&nbsp; Pistols, as you shall learn to your cost, if
you do not cease speaking in that gibberish and converse in
Castilian.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gallegans were silent, and presently
the first guide dropped behind, whilst the other with the lantern
moved before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep in the rear,&rdquo; said Antonio
to the former, &ldquo;and at a distance: know one thing,
moreover, that I can see behind as well as before.&nbsp; <i>Mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose these fellows will attempt to do us any harm, more
especially as they do not know each other; it is well, however,
to separate them, for this is a time and place which might tempt
any one to commit robbery and murder too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rain still continued to fall uninterruptedly, the path was
rugged and precipitous, and the night was so dark that we could
only see indistinctly the hills which surrounded us.&nbsp; Once
or twice our guide seemed to have lost his way: he stopped,
muttered to himself, raised his lantern on high, and would then
walk slowly and hesitatingly forward.&nbsp; In this manner we
proceeded for three or four hours, when I asked the guide how far
we were from Viveiro.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know exactly where we
are, your worship,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;though I believe we
are in the route.&nbsp; We can scarcely, however, be less than
two mad leagues from Viveiro.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we shall
not arrive there before morning,&rdquo; interrupted Antonio, <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>&ldquo;for a
mad league of Galicia means at least two of Castile; and perhaps
we are doomed never to arrive there, if the way thither leads
down this precipice.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he spoke, the guide seemed
to descend into the bowels of the earth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where are you
going?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To Viveiro, <i>Senhor</i>,&rdquo;
replied the fellow: &ldquo;this is the way to Viveiro; there is
no other.&nbsp; I now know where we are.&rdquo;&nbsp; The light
of the lantern shone upon the dark red features of the guide, who
had turned round to reply, as he stood some yards down the side
of a dingle or ravine overgrown with thick trees, beneath whose
leafy branches a frightfully steep path descended.&nbsp; I
dismounted from the pony, and delivering the bridle to the other
guide, said, &ldquo;Here is your master&rsquo;s horse; if you
please you may lead him down that abyss, but as for myself I wash
my hands of the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fellow, without a word
of reply, vaulted into the saddle, and with a <i>vamos</i>,
<i>Perico</i>! <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a> to the pony, impelled the creature to
the descent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, <i>Senhor</i>,&rdquo; said he
with the lantern, &ldquo;there is no time to be lost; my light
will be presently extinguished, and this is the worst bit in the
whole road.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought it very probable that he was
about to lead us to some den of cut-throats, where we might be
sacrificed; but, taking courage, I seized our own horse by the
bridle, and followed the fellow down the ravine amidst rocks and
brambles.&nbsp; The descent lasted nearly ten minutes, and ere we
had entirely accomplished it, the light in the lantern went out,
and we remained in nearly total darkness.</p>
<p>Encouraged, however, by the guide, who assured us there was no
danger, we at length reached the bottom of the ravine; here we
encountered a rill of water, <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>through which we were compelled to
wade as high as the knee.&nbsp; In the midst of the water I
looked up and caught a glimpse of the heavens through the
branches of the trees, which all around clothed the shelving
sides of the ravine, and completely embowered the channel of the
stream: to a place more strange and replete with gloom and horror
no benighted traveller ever found his way.&nbsp; After a short
pause we commenced scaling the opposite bank, which we did not
find so steep as the other, and a few minutes&rsquo; exertion
brought us to the top.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the rain abated, and the moon arising, cast
a dim light through the watery mists.&nbsp; The way had become
less precipitous, and in about two hours we descended to the
shore of an extensive creek, along which we proceeded till we
reached a spot where many boats and barges lay with their keels
upward upon the sand.&nbsp; Presently we beheld before us the
walls of Viveiro, upon which the moon was shedding its sickly
lustre.&nbsp; We entered by a lofty and seemingly ruinous
archway, and the guide conducted us at once to the
<i>posada</i>.</p>
<p>Every person in Viveiro appeared to be buried in profound
slumber; not so much as a dog saluted us with his bark.&nbsp;
After much knocking we were admitted into the <i>posada</i>, a
large and dilapidated edifice.&nbsp; We had scarcely housed
ourselves and horses when the rain began to fall with yet more
violence than before, attended with much thunder and
lightning.&nbsp; Antonio and I, exhausted with fatigue, betook
ourselves to flock beds in a ruinous chamber, into which the rain
penetrated through many a cranny, whilst the guides ate bread and
drank wine till the morning.</p>
<p>When I arose I was gladdened by the sight of a <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>fine
day.&nbsp; Antonio forthwith prepared a savoury breakfast of
stewed fowl, of which we stood in much need after the ten-league
journey of the preceding day over the ways which I have attempted
to describe.&nbsp; I then walked out to view the town, which
consists of little more than one long street, on the side of a
steep mountain thickly clad with forest and fruit-trees.&nbsp; At
about ten we continued our journey, accompanied by our first
guide, the other having returned to Coisa Doiro some hours
previously.</p>
<p>Our route throughout this day was almost constantly within
sight of the shores of the Cantabrian sea, whose windings we
followed.&nbsp; The country was barren, and in many parts covered
with huge stones: cultivated spots, however, were to be seen,
where vines were growing.&nbsp; We met with but few human
habitations.&nbsp; We, however, journeyed on cheerfully, for the
sun was once more shining in full brightness, gilding the wild
moors, and shining upon the waters of the distant sea, which lay
in unruffled calmness.</p>
<p>At evening fall we were in the neighbourhood of the shore,
with a range of wood-covered hills on our right.&nbsp; Our guide
led us towards a creek bordered by a marsh, but he soon stopped,
and declared that he did not know whither he was conducting
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio,
&ldquo;let us be our own guides; it is, as you see, of no use to
depend upon this fellow, whose whole science consists in leading
people into quagmires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We therefore turned aside, and proceeded along the marsh for a
considerable distance, till we reached a narrow path which led us
into a thick wood, where we soon became completely
bewildered.&nbsp; On a sudden, after wandering about a
considerable time, we heard <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>the noise of water, and presently the
clack of a wheel.&nbsp; Following the sound, we arrived at a low
stone mill, built over a brook; here we stopped and shouted, but
no answer was returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;The place is
deserted,&rdquo; said Antonio; &ldquo;here, however, is a path,
which, if we follow it, will doubtless lead us to some human
habitation.&nbsp; So we went along the path, which, in about ten
minutes, brought us to the door of a cabin, in which we saw
lights.&nbsp; Antonio dismounted and opened the door: &ldquo;Is
there any one here who can conduct us to Rivadeo?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senhor</i>,&rdquo; answered a voice, &ldquo;Rivadeo
is more than five leagues from here, and, moreover, there is a
river to cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to the next village,&rdquo; continued Antonio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a <i>vecino</i> of the next village, which is on
the way to Rivadeo,&rdquo; said another voice, &ldquo;and I will
lead you thither, if you will give me fair words, and, what is
better, fair money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man now came forth, holding in his hand a large stick.&nbsp;
He strode sturdily before us, and in less than half an hour led
us out of the wood.&nbsp; In another half-hour he brought us to a
group of cabins situated near the sea; he pointed to one of
these, and having received a <i>peseta</i>, bade us farewell.</p>
<p>The people of the cottage willingly consented to receive us
for the night; it was much more cleanly and commodious than the
wretched huts of the Gallegan peasantry in general.&nbsp; The
ground floor consisted of a keeping room and stable, whilst above
was a long loft, in which were some neat and comfortable flock
beds.&nbsp; I observed several masts and sails of boats.&nbsp;
The family consisted of two brothers, with their wives and
families.&nbsp; One was a fisherman; but <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the other,
who appeared to be the principal person, informed me that he had
resided for many years in service at Madrid, and, having amassed
a small sum, he had at length returned to his native village,
where he had purchased some land, which he farmed.&nbsp; All the
family used the Castilian language in their common discourse, and
on inquiry I learned that the Gallegan was not much spoken in
that neighbourhood.&nbsp; I have forgotten the name of this
village, which is situated on the estuary of the Foz, which rolls
down from Mondonedo.&nbsp; In the morning we crossed this estuary
in a large boat, with our horses, and about noon arrived at
Rivadeo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, your worship,&rdquo; said the guide, who had
accompanied us from Ferrol, &ldquo;I have brought you as far as I
bargained, and a hard journey it has been: I therefore hope you
will suffer Perico and myself to remain here to-night at your
expense, and to-morrow we will go back; at present we are both
sorely tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never mounted a better pony than Perico,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and never met with a worse guide than yourself.&nbsp;
You appear to be perfectly ignorant of the country, and have done
nothing but bring us into difficulties.&nbsp; You may, however,
stay here for the night, as you say you are tired, and to-morrow
you may return to Ferrol, where I counsel you to adopt some other
trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was said at the door of the
<i>posada</i> of Rivadeo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I lead the horses to a stable?&rdquo; said the
fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Antonio looked after him for a moment, as he was leading the
animals away, and then, shaking his head, followed slowly
after.&nbsp; In about a quarter of an hour <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>he returned,
laden with the furniture of our own horse, and with a smile upon
his countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I have throughout the journey had a bad opinion
of this fellow, and now I have detected him: his motive in
requesting permission to stay was a desire to purloin something
from us.&nbsp; He was very officious in the stable about our
horse, and I now miss the new leathern girth which secured the
saddle, and which I observed him looking at frequently on the
road.&nbsp; He has by this time doubtless hid it somewhere; we
are quite secure of him, however, for he has not yet received the
hire for the pony, nor the gratuity for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide returned just as he had concluded speaking.&nbsp;
Dishonesty is always suspicious.&nbsp; The fellow cast a glance
upon us, and probably beholding in our countenances something
which he did not like, he suddenly said, &ldquo;Give me the
horse-hire and my own <i>propina</i>, for Perico and I wish to be
off instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I thought you and
Perico were both fatigued, and wished to rest here for the night:
you have soon recovered from your weariness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought over the matter,&rdquo; said the fellow,
&ldquo;and my master will be angry if I loiter here: pay up,
therefore, and let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you wish it.&nbsp;
Is the horse furniture all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I delivered it all to
your servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all here,&rdquo; said Antonio, &ldquo;with the
exception of the leathern girth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not got it,&rdquo; said the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us
proceed to the stable; we shall perhaps find it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>To the
stable we went, which we searched through: no girth, however, was
forthcoming.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has got it buckled round his middle
beneath his pantaloons, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said
Antonio, whose eyes were moving about like those of a lynx;
&ldquo;I saw the protuberance as he stooped down.&nbsp; However,
let us take no notice: he is here surrounded by his countrymen,
who, if we were to seize him, might perhaps take his part.&nbsp;
As I said before, he is in our power, as we have not paid
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow now began to talk in Gallegan to the bystanders
(several persons having collected), wishing the <i>Denho</i> to
take him if he knew anything of the missing property.&nbsp;
Nobody, however, seemed inclined to take his part; and those who
listened only shrugged their shoulders.&nbsp; We returned to the
portal of the <i>posada</i>, the fellow following us, clamouring
for the horse-hire and <i>propina</i>.&nbsp; We made him no
answer, and at length he went away, threatening to apply to the
<i>justicia</i>; in about ten minutes, however, he came running
back with the girth in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have just found
it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the street: your servant dropped
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the leather and proceeded very deliberately to count
out the sum to which the horse-hire amounted, and having
delivered it to him in the presence of witnesses, I said,
&ldquo;During the whole journey you have been of no service to us
whatever; nevertheless, you have fared like ourselves, and have
had all you could desire to eat and drink.&nbsp; I intended, on
your leaving us, to present you, moreover, with a <i>propina</i>
of two dollars; but since, notwithstanding our kind treatment,
you endeavoured to pillage us, I will not give you a
<i>cuarto</i>: go, therefore, about your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the audience expressed their satisfaction at this <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>sentence, and
told him that he had been rightly-served, and that he was a
disgrace to Galicia.&nbsp; Two or three women crossed themselves,
and asked him if he was not afraid that the <i>Denho</i>, whom he
had invoked, would take him away.&nbsp; At last, a
respectable-looking man said to him, &ldquo;Are you not ashamed
to have attempted to rob two innocent strangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers!&rdquo; roared the fellow, who was by this
time foaming with rage, &ldquo;innocent strangers,
<i>carracho</i>! they know more of Spain and Galicia, too, than
the whole of us.&nbsp; Oh, <i>Denho</i>, that servant is no man,
but a wizard, a <i>nuveiro</i>.&mdash;Where is Perico?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mounted Perico, and proceeded forthwith to another
<i>posada</i>.&nbsp; The tale, however, of his dishonesty had
gone before him, and no person would house him; whereupon he
returned on his steps, and seeing me looking out of the window of
the house, he gave a savage shout, and shaking his fist at me,
galloped out of the town, the people pursuing him with hootings
and revilings.</p>

57</span>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Martin of Rivadeo&mdash;The Factious
Mare&mdash;Asturians&mdash;Luarca&mdash;The Seven
Bellotas&mdash;Hermits&mdash;The Asturian&rsquo;s
Tale&mdash;Strange Guests&mdash;The Big
Servant&mdash;Batuschca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What may your business be?&rdquo; said I to a short,
thick, merry-faced fellow in a velveteen jerkin and canvas
pantaloons, who made his way into my apartment in the dusk of the
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Martin of Rivadeo, your worship,&rdquo; replied
the man, &ldquo;an <i>alquilador</i> by profession.&nbsp; I am
told that you want a horse for your journey into the Asturias
to-morrow, and of course a guide: now, if that be the case, I
counsel you to hire myself and mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am become tired of guides,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;so much so that I was thinking of purchasing a pony, and
proceeding without any guide at all.&nbsp; The last which we had
was an infamous character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have been told, your worship, and it was well for
the <i>bribon</i> that I was not in Rivadeo when the affair to
which you allude occurred.&nbsp; But he was gone with the pony
Perico before I came back, or I would have bled the fellow to a
certainty with my knife.&nbsp; He is a disgrace to the
profession, which is one of the most honourable and ancient in
the world.&nbsp; Perico himself must have been ashamed of him,
for Perico, <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>though a pony, is a gentleman, one of many capacities,
and well known upon the roads.&nbsp; He is only inferior to my
mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you well acquainted with the road to Oviedo?&rdquo;
I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, your worship; that is, no farther than
Luarca, <a name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a> which is the first day&rsquo;s
journey.&nbsp; I do not wish to deceive you, therefore let me go
with you no farther than that place; though perhaps I might serve
for the whole journey, for though I am unacquainted with the
country, I have a tongue in my head, and nimble feet to run and
ask questions.&nbsp; I will, however, answer for myself no
farther than Luarca, where you can please yourselves.&nbsp; Your
being strangers is what makes me wish to accompany you, for I
like the conversation of strangers, from whom I am sure to gain
information both entertaining and profitable.&nbsp; I wish,
moreover, to convince you that we guides of Galicia are not all
thieves, which I am sure you will not suppose if you only permit
me to accompany you as far as Luarca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was so much struck with the fellow&rsquo;s good humour and
frankness, and more especially by the originality of character
displayed in almost every sentence which he uttered, that I
readily engaged him to guide us to Luarca; whereupon he left me,
promising to be ready with his mare at eight next morning.</p>
<p>Rivadeo is one of the principal seaports of Galicia, and is
admirably situated for commerce, on a deep firth, into which the
river Mirando <a name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a> debouches.&nbsp; It contains many
magnificent buildings, and an extensive <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>square or
<i>plaza</i>, which is planted with trees.&nbsp; I observed
several vessels in the harbour; and the population, which is
rather numerous, exhibited none of those marks of misery and
dejection which I had lately observed among the Ferrolese.</p>
<p>On the morrow Martin of Rivadeo made his appearance at the
appointed hour with his mare.&nbsp; It was a lean haggard animal,
not much larger than a pony; it had good points, however, and was
very clean in its hinder legs, and Martin insisted that it was
the best animal of its kind in all Spain.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
factious mare,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I believe an
Alavese.&nbsp; When the Carlists came here it fell lame, and they
left it behind, and I purchased it for a dollar.&nbsp; It is not
lame now, however, as you shall soon see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had now reached the firth which divides Galicia from the
Asturias.&nbsp; A kind of barge was lying about two yards from
the side of the quay, waiting to take us over.&nbsp; Towards this
Martin led his mare, and giving an encouraging shout, the
creature without any hesitation sprang over the intervening space
into the barge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you she was a
<i>facciosa</i>,&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;none but a factious
animal would have taken such a leap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all embarked in the barge and crossed over the firth, which
is in this place nearly a mile broad, to Castro Pol, <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> the first town in the Asturias.&nbsp; I
now mounted the factious mare, whilst Antonio followed on my own
horse.&nbsp; Martin led the way, exchanging jests with every
person whom he met on the road, and occasionally enlivening the
way with an extemporaneous song.</p>
<p>We were now in the Asturias, and about noon we reached Navias,
a small fishing-town, situate on a <i>ria</i> <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>or firth: in
the neighbourhood are ragged mountains called the Sierra de
Buron, which stand in the shape of a semicircle.&nbsp; We saw a
small vessel in the harbour, which we subsequently learned was
from the Basque provinces, come for a cargo of cider or
<i>sagadua</i>, the beverage so dearly loved by the
Basques.&nbsp; As we passed along the narrow street, Antonio was
hailed with an &ldquo;<i>Ola</i>!&rdquo; from a species of shop
in which three men, apparently shoemakers, were seated.&nbsp; He
stopped for some time to converse with them, and when he joined
us at the <i>posada</i> where we halted, I asked him who they
were: &ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;<i>ce sont des messieurs de ma connoissance</i>.&nbsp; I
have been fellow-servant at different times with all three; and I
tell you beforehand, that we shall scarcely pass through a
village in this country where I shall not find an
acquaintance.&nbsp; All the Asturians, at some period of their
lives, make a journey to Madrid, where, if they can obtain a
situation, they remain until they have scraped up sufficient to
turn to advantage in their own country; and as I have served in
all the great houses in Madrid, I am acquainted with the greatest
part of them.&nbsp; I have nothing to say against the Asturians,
save that they are close and penurious whilst at service; but
they are not thieves, neither at home nor abroad, and though we
must have our wits about us in their country, I have heard we may
travel from one end of it to the other without the slightest fear
of being either robbed or ill-treated, which is not the case in
Galicia, where we were always in danger of having our throats
cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Navias, we proceeded through a wild desolate country,
till we reached the pass of Baralla, which lies up the side of a
huge wall of rocks, which at a <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>distance appear of a light green
colour, though perfectly bare of herbage or plants of any
description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pass,&rdquo; said Martin of Rivadeo, &ldquo;bears
a very evil reputation, and I should not like to travel it after
sunset.&nbsp; It is not infested by robbers, but by things much
worse, the <i>duendes</i> of two friars of Saint Francis.&nbsp;
It is said that in the old time, long before the convents were
suppressed, two friars of the order of Saint Francis left their
convent to beg.&nbsp; It chanced that they were very successful,
but as they were returning at nightfall by this pass, they had a
quarrel about what they had collected, each insisting that he had
done his duty better than the other; at last, from high words
they fell to abuse, and from abuse to blows.&nbsp; What do you
think these demons of friars did?&nbsp; They took off their
cloaks, and at the end of each they made a knot, in which they
placed a large stone, and with these they thrashed and belaboured
each other till both fell dead.&nbsp; Master, I know not which
are the worst plagues, friars, curates, or sparrows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;May the Lord God preserve us from evil
birds three:<br />
From all friars and curates and sparrows that be;<br />
For the sparrows eat up all the corn that we sow,<br />
The friars drink down all the wine that we grow,<br />
Whilst the curates have all the fair dames at their nod:<br />
From these three evil curses preserve us, Lord
God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In about two hours from this time we reached Luarca, the
situation of which is most singular.&nbsp; It stands in a deep
hollow, whose sides are so precipitous that it is impossible to
descry the town until you stand just above it.&nbsp; At the
northern extremity of this hollow is a small harbour, the sea
entering by a narrow cleft.&nbsp; We found a large and
comfortable <i>posada</i>, and by the advice of Martin, made
inquiry for a fresh guide <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and horse; we were informed, however,
that all the horses of the place were absent, and that if we
waited for their return, we must tarry for two days.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had a presentiment,&rdquo; said Martin, &ldquo;when we
entered Luarca, that we were not doomed to part at present.&nbsp;
You must now hire my mare and me as far as Gijon, <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a> from whence there is a conveyance to
Oviedo.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I am by no means sorry that
the guides are absent, for I am pleased with your company, as I
make no doubt you are with mine.&nbsp; I will now go and write a
letter to my wife at Rivadeo, informing her that she must not
expect to see me back for several days.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then went
out of the room, singing the following stanza:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A handless man a letter did write,<br />
A dumb dictated it word for word:<br />
The person who read it had lost his sight,<br />
And deaf was he who listened and heard.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early the next morning we emerged from the hollow of Luarca;
about an hour&rsquo;s riding brought us to Caneiro, a deep and
romantic valley of rocks, shaded by tall chestnut trees.&nbsp;
Through the midst of this valley rushes a rapid stream, which we
crossed in a boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is not such a stream for
trout in all the Asturias,&rdquo; said the ferryman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look down into the waters and observe the large stones
over which it flows; now in the proper season, and in fine
weather, you cannot see those stones for the multitudes of fish
which cover them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the valley behind us, we entered into a wild and
dreary country, stony and mountainous.&nbsp; The day was dull and
gloomy, and all around looked sad <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>and melancholy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are we
in the way for Gijon and Oviedo?&rdquo; demanded Martin of an
ancient female, who stood at the door of a cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Gijon and Oviedo!&rdquo; replied the crone;
&ldquo;many is the weary step you will have to make before you
reach Gijon and Oviedo.&nbsp; You must first of all crack the
<i>bellotas</i>: you are just below them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she mean by cracking the
<i>bellotas</i>?&rdquo; demanded I of Martin of Rivadeo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your worship never hear of the seven
<i>bellotas</i>?&rdquo; replied our guide.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
scarcely tell you what they are, as I have never seen them; I
believe they are seven hills which we have to cross, and are
called <i>bellotas</i> from some resemblance to acorns which it
is fancied they bear.&nbsp; I have often heard of these acorns,
and am not sorry that I have now an opportunity of seeing them,
though it is said that they are rather hard things for horses to
digest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Asturian mountains in this part rise to a considerable
altitude.&nbsp; They consist for the most part of dark granite,
covered here and there with a thin layer of earth.&nbsp; They
approach very near to the sea, to which they slope down in broken
ridges, between which are deep and precipitous defiles, each with
its rivulet, the tribute of the hills to the salt flood.&nbsp;
The road traverses these defiles.&nbsp; There are seven of them,
which are called, in the language of the country, <i>Las siete
bellotas</i>.&nbsp; Of all these the most terrible is the
midmost, down which rolls an impetuous torrent.&nbsp; At the
upper end of it rises a precipitous wall of rock, black as soot,
to the height of several hundred yards; its top, as we passed,
was enveloped with a veil of <i>bretima</i>.&nbsp; From this
gorge branch off, on either side, small dingles or glens, some of
them so overgrown with <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>trees and copsewood, that the eye is
unable to penetrate the obscurity beyond a few yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine places would some of these dingles prove for
hermitages,&rdquo; said I to Martin of Rivadeo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Holy
men might lead a happy life there on roots and water, and pass
many years absorbed in heavenly contemplation without ever being
disturbed by the noise and turmoil of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, your worship,&rdquo; replied Martin; &ldquo;and
perhaps on that very account there are no hermitages in the
<i>barrancos</i> of the seven <i>bellotas</i>.&nbsp; Our hermits
had little inclination for roots and water, and had no kind of
objection to be occasionally disturbed in their
meditations.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>!&nbsp; I never yet saw a hermitage
that was not hard by some rich town or village, or was not a
regular resort for all the idle people in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Hermits are not fond of living in dingles,
amongst wolves and foxes; for how in that case could they dispose
of their poultry?&nbsp; A hermit of my acquaintance left, when he
died, a fortune of seven hundred dollars to his niece, the
greatest part of which he scraped up by fattening
turkeys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the top of this <i>bellota</i> we found a wretched
<i>venta</i>, where we refreshed ourselves, and then continued
our journey.&nbsp; Late in the afternoon we cleared the last of
these difficult passes.&nbsp; The wind began now to rise, bearing
on its wings a drizzling rain.&nbsp; We passed by Soto Luino, and
shaping our course through a wild but picturesque country, we
found ourselves about nightfall at the foot of a steep hill, up
which led a narrow bridle-way, amidst a grove of lofty
trees.&nbsp; Long before we had reached the top it had become
quite dark, and the rain had increased considerably.&nbsp; We
stumbled along in the obscurity, leading our horses, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>which were
occasionally down on their knees, owing to the slipperiness of
the path.&nbsp; At last we accomplished the ascent in safety, and
pushing briskly forward, we found ourselves in about half an hour
at the entrance of Muros, a large village situated just on the
declivity of the farther side of the hill.</p>
<p>A blazing fire in the <i>posada</i> soon dried our wet
garments, and in some degree recompensed us for the fatigues
which we had undergone in scrambling up the
<i>bellotas</i>.&nbsp; A rather singular place was this same
<i>posada</i> of Muros.&nbsp; It was a large rambling house, with
a spacious kitchen, or common room, on the ground floor.&nbsp;
Above stairs was a large dining apartment, with an immense oak
table, and furnished with cumbrous leathern chairs with high
backs, apparently three centuries old at least.&nbsp;
Communicating with this apartment was a wooden gallery, open to
the air, which led to a small chamber, in which I was destined to
sleep, and which contained an old-fashioned tester-bed with
curtains.&nbsp; It was just one of those inns which romance
writers are so fond of introducing in their descriptions,
especially when the scene of adventure lies in Spain.&nbsp; The
host was a talkative Asturian.</p>
<p>The wind still howled, and the rain descended in
torrents.&nbsp; I sat before the fire in a very drowsy state,
from which I was presently aroused by the conversation of the
host.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
is now three years since I beheld foreigners in my house.&nbsp; I
remember it was about this time of the year, and just such a
night as this, that two men on horseback arrived here.&nbsp; What
was singular, they came without any guide.&nbsp; Two more
strange-looking individuals I never yet beheld with
eye-sight.&nbsp; I shall never forget them.&nbsp; The one was as
tall as a giant, with much tawny <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>moustache, like the coat of a badger,
growing about his mouth.&nbsp; He had a huge ruddy face, and
looked dull and stupid, as he no doubt was, for when I spoke to
him he did not seem to understand, and answered in a jabber,
<i>valgame Dios</i>! <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a> so wild and strange,
that I remained staring at him with mouth and eyes open.&nbsp;
The other was neither tall nor red-faced, nor had he hair about
his mouth, and indeed he had very little upon his head.&nbsp; He
was very diminutive, and looked like a <i>jorobado</i>; but,
<i>valgame Dios</i>! such eyes, like wild cats&rsquo;, so sharp
and full of malice.&nbsp; He spoke as good Spanish as I myself
do, and yet he was no Spaniard.&nbsp; Spaniard never looked like
that man.&nbsp; He was dressed in a <i>zamarra</i>, with much
silver and embroidery, and wore an Andalusian hat, and I soon
found that he was master, and that the other was servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Valgame Dios</i>! what an evil disposition had that
same foreign <i>jorobado</i>! and yet he had much grace, much
humour, and said occasionally to me such comical things, that I
was fit to die of laughter.&nbsp; So he sat down to supper in the
room above, and I may as well tell you here, that he slept in the
same chamber where your worship will sleep to-night, and his
servant waited behind his chair.&nbsp; Well, I had curiosity, so
I sat myself down at the table too, without asking leave.&nbsp;
Why should I?&nbsp; I was in my own house, and an Asturian is fit
company for a king, and is often of better blood.&nbsp; Oh, what
a strange supper was that.&nbsp; If the servant made the
slightest mistake in helping him, up would start the
<i>jorobado</i>, jump upon his chair, and seizing the big giant
by the hair, would cuff him on both sides of his face till I was
afraid his teeth would have <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>fallen out.&nbsp; The giant, however,
did not seem to care about it much.&nbsp; He was used to it, I
suppose.&nbsp; <i>Valgame Dios</i>! if he had been a Spaniard he
would not have submitted to it so patiently.&nbsp; But what
surprised me most was, that after beating his servant the master
would sit down, and the next moment would begin conversing and
laughing with him as if nothing had happened, and the giant also
would laugh and converse with his master, for all the world as if
he had not been beaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well suppose, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, that I
understood nothing of their discourse, for it was all in that
strange unchristian tongue in which the giant answered me when I
spoke to him; the sound of it is still ringing in my ears.&nbsp;
It was nothing like other languages.&nbsp; Not like Bascuen, <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> not like the language in which your
worship speaks to my namesake <i>Signor</i> Antonio here.&nbsp;
<i>Valgame Dios</i>!&nbsp; I can compare it to nothing but the
sound a person makes when he rinses his mouth with water.&nbsp;
There is one word which I think I still remember, for it was
continually proceeding from the giant&rsquo;s lips, but his
master never used it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the strangest part of the story is yet to be
told.&nbsp; The supper was ended, and the night was rather
advanced; the rain still beat against the windows, even as it
does at this moment.&nbsp; Suddenly the <i>jorobado</i> pulled
out his watch.&nbsp; <i>Valgame Dios</i>! such a watch!&nbsp; I
will tell you one thing, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, that I could
purchase all the Asturias, and Muros besides, with the brilliants
which shone about the sides of that same watch; the room wanted
no lamp, I trow, so great was the splendour which they
cast.&nbsp; So the <i>jorobado</i> looked at his watch, and then
said to me, &lsquo;I shall go to rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; He <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>then took the
lamp, and went through the gallery to his room, followed by his
big servant.&nbsp; Well, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, I cleared away the
things, and then waited below for the servant, for whom I had
prepared a comfortable bed, close by my own.&nbsp;
<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, I waited patiently for an hour, till at last
my patience was exhausted, and I ascended to the supper
apartment, and passed through the gallery till I came to the door
of the strange guest.&nbsp; <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, what do you
think I saw at the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
riding-boots, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, I did not see his
riding-boots; but, stretched on the floor with his head against
the door, so that it was impossible to open it without disturbing
him, lay the big servant fast asleep, his immense legs reaching
nearly the whole length of the gallery.&nbsp; I crossed myself,
as well I might, for the wind was howling even as it is now, and
the rain was rushing down into the gallery in torrents; yet there
lay the big servant fast asleep, without any covering, without
any pillow, not even a log, stretched out before his
master&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, I got little rest that night, for
I said to myself, I have evil wizards in my house, folks who are
not human.&nbsp; Once or twice I went up and peeped into the
gallery, but there still lay the big servant fast asleep; so I
crossed myself, and returned to my bed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and what occurred next
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing particular occurred next day: the
<i>jorobado</i> came down and said comical things to me in good
Spanish; and the big servant came down, but whatever he said, and
he did not say much, I understood not, for it was in that
disastrous jabber.&nbsp; They stayed <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>with me throughout the day till after
supper-time, and then the <i>jorobado</i> gave me a gold ounce,
and mounting their horses, they both departed as strangely as
they had come, in the dark night, I know not whither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, it is not all; for I was right
in supposing them evil <i>brujos</i>: the very next day an
express arrived, and a great search was made after them, and I
was arrested for having harboured them.&nbsp; This occurred just
after the present wars had commenced.&nbsp; It was said they were
spies and emissaries of I don&rsquo;t know what nation, and that
they had been in all parts of the Asturias, holding conferences
with some of the disaffected.&nbsp; They escaped, however, and
were never heard of more, though the animals which they rode were
found without their riders, wandering amongst the hills; they
were common ponies, and were of no value.&nbsp; As for the
<i>brujos</i>, it is believed that they embarked in some small
vessel which was lying concealed in one of the <i>rias</i> of the
coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What was the word which you continually
heard proceeding from the lips of the big servant, and which you
think you can remember?</p>
<p><i>Host</i>.&mdash;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, it is now three years
since I heard it, and at times I can remember it, and at others
not; sometimes I have started up in my sleep repeating it.&nbsp;
Stay, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, I have it now at the point of my
tongue: it was <i>Patusca</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;<i>Batuschca</i>, you mean; the men were
Russians.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Oviedo&mdash;The Ten Gentlemen&mdash;The Swiss
again&mdash;Modest Request&mdash;The Robbers&mdash;Episcopal
Benevolence&mdash;The Cathedral&mdash;Portrait of Feijoo.</p>
<p>I must now take a considerable stride in my journey, no less
than from Muros to Oviedo, contenting myself with observing, that
we proceeded from Muros to Velez, <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a> and from thence to
Gijon, where our guide Martin bade us farewell, and returned with
his mare to Rivadeo.&nbsp; The honest fellow did not part without
many expressions of regret; indeed he even expressed a desire
that I should take him and his mare into my service.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a great desire to run
through all Spain, and even the world: and I am sure I shall
never have a better opportunity than by attaching myself to your
worship&rsquo;s skirts.&rdquo;&nbsp; On my reminding him,
however, of his wife and family, for he had both, he said,
&ldquo;True, true, I had forgotten them: happy the guide whose
only wife and family are a mare and foal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oviedo is about three leagues from Gijon.&nbsp; Antonio rode
the horse, whilst I proceeded thither in a kind of diligence
which runs daily between the two towns.&nbsp; The road is good,
but mountainous.&nbsp; I arrived safely at the capital of the
Asturias, although at a rather <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>unpropitious season, for the din of
war was at the gate, and there was the cry of the captains and
the shouting. <a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; Castile, at the time of which I
am writing, was in the hands of the Carlists, who had captured
and plundered Valladolid in much the same manner as they had
Segovia some time before.&nbsp; They were every day expected to
march on Oviedo, in which case they might perhaps have
experienced some resistance, a considerable body of troops being
stationed there, who had erected some redoubts, and strongly
fortified several of the convents, especially that of Santa Clara
de la Vega.&nbsp; All minds were in a state of feverish anxiety
and suspense, more especially as no intelligence arrived from
Madrid, which by the last accounts was said to be occupied by the
bands of Cabrera and Palillos.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that one night I found myself in the
ancient town of Oviedo, in a very large, scantily furnished, and
remote room in an ancient <i>posada</i>, formerly a palace of the
counts of Santa Cruz.&nbsp; It was past ten, and the rain was
descending in torrents.&nbsp; I was writing, but suddenly ceased
on hearing numerous footsteps ascending the creaking stairs which
led to my apartment.&nbsp; The door was flung open, and in walked
nine men of tall stature, marshalled by a little hunchbacked
personage.&nbsp; They were all muffled in the long cloaks of
Spain, but I instantly knew by their demeanour that they were
<i>caballeros</i>, or gentlemen.&nbsp; They placed themselves in
a rank before the table where I was sitting.&nbsp; Suddenly and
simultaneously they all flung back their cloaks, and I perceived
that every one bore a book in his hand; a book which I knew full
well.&nbsp; After a pause, which I was <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>unable to break, for I sat lost in
astonishment, and almost conceived myself to be visited by
apparitions, the hunchback, advancing somewhat before the rest,
said in soft silvery tones, &ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Cavalier,
was it you who brought this book to the Asturias?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
now supposed that they were the civil authorities of the place
come to take me into custody, and, rising from my seat, I
exclaimed, &ldquo;It certainly was I, and it is my glory to have
done so.&nbsp; The book is the New Testament of God: I wish it
was in my power to bring a million.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
heartily wish so too,&rdquo; said the little personage with a
sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be under no apprehension, Sir Cavalier; these
gentlemen are my friends.&nbsp; We have just purchased these
books in the shop where you placed them for sale, and have taken
the liberty of calling upon you, in order to return you our
thanks for the treasure you have brought us.&nbsp; I hope you can
furnish us with the Old Testament also.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied,
that I was sorry to inform him that at present it was entirely
out of my power to comply with his wish, as I had no Old
Testaments in my possession, but did not despair of procuring
some speedily from England.&nbsp; He then asked me a great many
questions concerning my biblical travels in Spain, and my
success, and the views entertained by the Society with respect to
Spain, adding, that he hoped we should pay particular attention
to the Asturias, which he assured me was the best ground in the
Peninsula for our labour.&nbsp; After about half an hour&rsquo;s
conversation, he suddenly said, in the English language,
&ldquo;Good night, sir,&rdquo; wrapped his cloak around him, and
walked out as he had come.&nbsp; His companions, who had hitherto
not uttered a word, all repeated, &ldquo;Good night, sir,&rdquo;
and, adjusting their cloaks, followed him.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>In
order to explain this strange scene, I must state, that in the
morning I had visited the petty bookseller of the place,
Longoria, and having arranged preliminaries with him, I sent him
in the evening a package of forty Testaments, all I possessed,
with some advertisements.&nbsp; At the time he assured me that,
though he was willing to undertake the sale, there was,
nevertheless, not a prospect of success, as a whole month had
elapsed since he had sold a book of any description, on account
of the uncertainty of the times, and the poverty which pervaded
the land; I therefore felt much dispirited.&nbsp; This incident,
however, admonished me not to be cast down when things look
gloomiest, as the hand of the Lord is generally then most busy:
that men may learn to perceive, that whatever good is
accomplished is not their work, but His.</p>
<p>Two or three days after this adventure, I was once more seated
in my large scantily-furnished room; it was about ten, of a dark
melancholy morning, and the autumnal rain was again
falling.&nbsp; I had just breakfasted, and was about to sit down
to my journal, when the door was flung open and in bounded
Antonio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said he, quite
breathless, &ldquo;who do you think has arrived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pretender, I suppose,&rdquo; said I, in some
trepidation; &ldquo;if so, we are prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah, bah!&rdquo; said Antonio, &ldquo;it is not the
Pretender, but one worth twenty of him; it is the Swiss of Saint
James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benedict Mol, the Swiss!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What! has he found the treasure?&nbsp; But how did he
come?&nbsp; How is he dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio, &ldquo;he
came on foot, if we may judge by his shoes, through which his
toes <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>are
sticking; and as for his dress, he is in most villanous
apparel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some mystery in this,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is he at present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Below, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; replied Antonio;
&ldquo;he came in quest of us.&nbsp; But I no sooner saw him,
than I hurried away to let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Benedict Mol found his way upstairs.&nbsp; He
was, as Antonio had remarked, in most villanous apparel, and
nearly barefooted; his old Andalusian hat was dripping with
rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Och</i>, <i>lieber Herr</i>,&rdquo; said Benedict,
&ldquo;how rejoiced I am to see you again!&nbsp; Oh, the sight of
your countenance almost repays me for all the miseries I have
undergone since I parted with you at Saint James.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I can scarcely believe that I really see
you here at Oviedo.&nbsp; What motive can have induced you to
come to such an out-of-the-way place from such an immense
distance?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;<i>Lieber Herr</i>, I will sit down and
tell you all that has befallen me.&nbsp; Some few days after I
saw you last, the <i>canonigo</i> persuaded me to go to the
captain-general to apply for permission to disinter the
<i>Schatz</i>, and also to crave assistance.&nbsp; So I saw the
captain-general, who at first received me very kindly, asked me
several questions, and told me to come again.&nbsp; So I
continued visiting him till he would see me no longer, and, do
what I might, I could not obtain a glance of him.&nbsp; The canon
now became impatient, more especially as he had given me a few
<i>pesetas</i> out of the charities of the church.&nbsp; He
frequently called me a <i>bribon</i> and impostor.&nbsp; At last,
one morning I went to him, and said that I proposed to return to
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Madrid, in
order to lay the matter before the government, and requested that
he would give me a certificate to the effect that I had performed
a pilgrimage to Saint James, which I imagined would be of
assistance to me upon the way, as it would enable me to beg with
some colour of authority.&nbsp; He no sooner heard this request,
than, without saying a word or allowing me a moment to put myself
on my defence, he sprang upon me like a tiger, clasping my throat
so hard that I thought he would have strangled me.&nbsp; I am a
Swiss, however, and a man of Lucerne, and when I had recovered
myself a little, I had no difficulty in flinging him off; I then
threatened him with my staff and went away.&nbsp; He followed me
to the gate with the most horrid curses, saying, that if I
presumed to return again, he would have me thrown at once into
prison as a thief and a heretic.&nbsp; So I went in quest of
yourself, <i>lieber Herr</i>, but they told me that you were
departed for Corunna; I then set out for Corunna after you.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what befell you on the road?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;I will tell you: about half-way between
Saint James and Corunna, as I was walking along, thinking of the
<i>Schatz</i>, I heard a loud galloping, and looking around me I
saw two men on horseback coming across the field with the
swiftness of the wind, and making directly for me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Lieber Gott</i>,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;these are
thieves, these are factious;&rdquo; and so they were.&nbsp; They
came up to me in a moment and bade me stand; so I flung down my
staff, took off my hat, and saluted them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good day,
<i>caballeros</i>,&rdquo; said I to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good day,
countryman,&rdquo; said they to me, and then we stood staring at
each other for more than a minute.&nbsp; <i>Lieber Himmel</i>, <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a> I never saw such robbers; so finely
dressed, <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>so well armed, and mounted so bravely on two fiery
little <i>hakkas</i>, <a name="citation76"></a><a
href="#footnote76" class="citation">[76]</a> that looked as if
they could have taken wing and flown up into the clouds!&nbsp; So
we continued staring at each other, till at last one asked me who
I was, whence I came, and where I was going.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am a Swiss; I have been
to Saint James to perform a religious vow, and am now returning
to my own country.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said not a word about the
treasure, for I was afraid that they would have shot me at once,
conceiving that I carried part of it about me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
you any money?&rdquo; they demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you see how I travel
on foot, with my shoes torn to pieces; I should not do so if I
had money.&nbsp; I will not deceive you, however; I have a
<i>peseta</i> and a few <i>cuartos</i>;&rdquo; and thereupon I
took out what I had and offered it to them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;we are <i>caballeros</i>
of Galicia, and do not take <i>pesetas</i>, much less
<i>cuartos</i>.&nbsp; Of what opinion are you?&nbsp; Are you for
the queen?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, gentlemen,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;I am not for the queen; but, at the same time, allow me to
tell you that I am not for the king either.&nbsp; I know nothing
about the matter; I am a Swiss, and fight neither for nor against
anybody unless I am paid.&rdquo;&nbsp; This made them laugh, and
then they questioned me about Saint James, and the troops there,
and the captain-general; and not to disoblige them, I told them
all I knew, and much more.&nbsp; Then one of them, who looked the
fiercest and most determined, took his trombone in his hand, and
pointing it at me, said, &ldquo;Had you been a Spaniard, we
should have blown your head to shivers, for we should have
thought you a spy; but we see you are a foreigner, and believe
what you have said.&nbsp; Take, therefore, this <i>peseta</i> and
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>go your
way; but beware that you tell nobody anything about us, for if
you do, <i>carracho</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then discharged his
trombone just over my head, so that for a moment I thought myself
shot; and then with an awful shout, they both galloped away,
their horses leaping over the <i>barrancos</i>, as if possessed
with many devils.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what happened to you on your arrival
at Corunna?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;When I arrived at Corunna, I inquired
after yourself, <i>lieber Herr</i>, and they informed me that,
only the day before my arrival, you had departed for Oviedo: and
when I heard that, my heart died within me, for I was now at the
far end of Galicia, without a friend to help me.&nbsp; For a day
or two I knew not what to do; at last I determined to make for
the frontier of France, passing through Oviedo in the way, where
I hoped to see you, and ask counsel of you.&nbsp; So I begged and
bettled among the Germans of Corunna.&nbsp; I, however, got very
little from them, only a few <i>cuarts</i>, less than the thieves
had given me on the road from Saint James, and with these I
departed for the Asturias by the way of Mondonedo.&nbsp;
<i>Och</i>, what a town is that, full of canons, priests, and
<i>pfaffen</i>, all of them more Carlist than Carlos himself.</p>
<p>One day I went to the bishop&rsquo;s palace and spoke to him,
telling him I was a pilgrim from Saint James, and requesting
assistance.&nbsp; He told me, however, that he could not relieve
me, and as for my being a pilgrim from Saint James, he was glad
of it, and hoped that it would be of service to my soul.&nbsp; So
I left Mondonedo, and got amongst the wild mountains, begging and
bettling at the door of every <i>choza</i> that I passed; telling
all I saw that I was a pilgrim from Saint James, and showing my
passport in proof that I had been <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>there.&nbsp; <i>Lieber Herr</i>, no
person gave me a <i>cuart</i>, nor even a piece of <i>broa</i>,
and both Gallegans and Asturians laughed at Saint James, and told
me that his name was no longer a passport in Spain.&nbsp; I
should have starved if I had not sometimes plucked an ear or two
out of the maize fields; I likewise gathered grapes from the
<i>parras</i> and berries from the brambles, and in this manner I
subsisted till I arrived at the <i>bellotas</i>, where I
slaughtered a stray kid which I met, and devoured part of the
flesh raw, so great was my hunger.&nbsp; It made me, however,
very ill; and for two days I lay in a <i>barranco</i> half dead
and unable to help myself; it was a mercy that I was not devoured
by the wolves.&nbsp; I then struck across the country for Oviedo:
how I reached it I do not know; I was like one walking in a
dream.&nbsp; Last night I slept in an empty hog-sty about two
leagues from here, and ere I left it, I fell down on my knees and
prayed to God that I might find you, <i>lieber Herr</i>, for you
were my last hope.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what do you propose to do at
present?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;What can I say, <i>lieber
Herr</i>?&nbsp; I know not what to do.&nbsp; I will be guided in
everything by your counsel.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I shall remain at Oviedo a few days
longer, during which time you can lodge at this <i>posada</i>,
and endeavour to recover from the fatigue of your disastrous
journeys; perhaps before I depart, we may hit on some plan to
extricate you from your present difficulties.</p>
<p>Oviedo contains about fifteen thousand inhabitants.&nbsp; It
is picturesquely situated between two mountains, Morcin and
Naranco; the former is very high and rugged, and during the
greater part of the year is <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>covered with snow; the sides of the
latter are cultivated and planted with vines.&nbsp; The principal
ornament of the town is the cathedral, <a
name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a> the tower of which is exceedingly
lofty, and is perhaps one of the purest specimens of Gothic
architecture at present in existence.&nbsp; The interior of the
cathedral is neat and appropriate, but simple and
unadorned.&nbsp; I observed but one picture, the Conversion of
Saint Paul.&nbsp; One of the chapels is a cemetery, in which rest
the bones of eleven Gothic kings; to whose souls be peace.</p>
<p>I bore a letter of recommendation from Corunna to a merchant
of Oviedo.&nbsp; This person received me very courteously, and
generally devoted some portion of every day to showing me the
remarkable things of Oviedo.</p>
<p>One morning he thus addressed me: &ldquo;You have doubtless
heard of Feijoo, <a name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b"
class="citation">[79b]</a> the celebrated philosophic <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>monk of the
order of Saint Benedict, whose writings have so much tended to
remove the popular fallacies and superstitions so long cherished
in Spain; he is buried in one of our convents, where he passed a
considerable portion of his life.&nbsp; Come with me and I will
show you his portrait.&nbsp; Carlos Tercero, <a
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a> our great king, sent his own painter
from Madrid to execute it.&nbsp; It is now in the possession of a
friend of mine, Don Ramon Valdez, an advocate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he led me to the house of Don Ramon Valdez, who very
politely exhibited the portrait of Feijoo.&nbsp; It was circular
in shape, about a foot in diameter, and was surrounded by a
little brass frame, something like the rim of a barber&rsquo;s
basin.&nbsp; The countenance was large and massive, but fine, the
eyebrows knit, the eyes sharp and penetrating, nose
aquiline.&nbsp; On the head was a silken skull-cap; the collar of
the coat or vest was just perceptible.&nbsp; The painting was
decidedly good, and struck me as being one of the very best
specimens of modern Spanish art which I had hitherto seen.</p>
<p>A day or two after this I said to Benedict Mol,
&ldquo;To-morrow I start from hence for Santander.&nbsp; It is
therefore high time that you decide upon some course, whether to
return to Madrid or to make the best of your way to France, and
from thence proceed to your own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;<i>Lieber Herr</i>,&rdquo; said Benedict,
&ldquo;I will follow you to Santander by short journeys, for I am
unable to make long ones amongst these hills; and when I am
there, peradventure I may find some means of passing into
France.&nbsp; It is a great comfort, in my horrible journeys, to
think that I am travelling over the ground which yourself have
trodden, and to hope that I am proceeding to rejoin you once
more.&nbsp; This hope kept me alive in the <i>bellotas</i>, and
without it I should never have reached Oviedo.&nbsp; I will quit
Spain as soon as possible, and betake me to Lucerne, though it is
a hard thing to leave the <i>Schatz</i> behind me in the land of
the Gallegans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I presented him with a few dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange man is this Benedict,&rdquo; said Antonio to
me next morning, as, accompanied by a guide, we sallied forth
from Oviedo; &ldquo;a strange man, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, is
this same Benedict.&nbsp; A strange life has he led, and a
strange death he will die,&mdash;it is written on his
countenance.&nbsp; That he will leave Spain I do not believe, or
if he leave it, it will be only to return, for he is bewitched
about this treasure.&nbsp; Last night he sent for a
<i>sorci&egrave;re</i> whom he consulted in my presence: and she
told him that he was doomed to possess it, but that first of all
he must cross water.&nbsp; She cautioned him likewise against an
enemy, which he supposes must be the canon of Saint James.&nbsp;
I have often heard people speak of the avidity of the Swiss for
money, and here is a proof of it.&nbsp; I would not undergo what
Benedict has suffered in these last journeys of his to possess
all the treasures in Spain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we left Oviedo and directed our course towards
Santander.&nbsp; The man who accompanied us as guide, and from
whom I hired the pony on which I rode, had been recommended to me
by my friend the merchant of Oviedo.&nbsp; He proved, however, a
lazy, indolent fellow; he was generally loitering two or three
hundred yards in our rear, and instead of enlivening the way with
song and tale, like our late guide, Martin of Rivadeo, he
scarcely ever opened his lips, save to tell us not to go so fast,
or that I should burst his pony if I spurred him so.&nbsp; He was
thievish withal, and though he had engaged to make the journey
<i>seco</i>, <a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a> that is, to defray the charges of
himself and beast, he contrived throughout to keep both at our
expense.&nbsp; When journeying in Spain, it is invariably the
cheapest plan to agree to maintain the guide and his horse or
mule, for by so doing the hire is diminished at least one-third,
and the bills upon the road are seldom increased; whereas, in the
other case, he pockets the <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>difference, and yet goes shot free,
and at the expense of the traveller, through the connivance of
the innkeepers, who have a kind of fellow-feeling with the
guides.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon we reached Villa Viciosa, a small dirty
town, at the distance of eight leagues from Oviedo: it stands
beside a creek which communicates with the Bay of Biscay.&nbsp;
It is sometimes called La Capital de las Avellanas, or the
Capital of the Filberts, from the immense quantity of this fruit
which is grown in the neighbourhood; and the greatest part of
which is exported to England.&nbsp; As we drew nigh we overtook
numerous carts laden with <i>avellanas</i> proceeding in the
direction of the town.&nbsp; I was informed that several small
English vessels were lying in the harbour.&nbsp; Singular as it
may seem, however, notwithstanding we were in the Capital of the
Avellanas, it was with the utmost difficulty that I procured a
scanty handful for my dessert, and of these more than one-half
were decayed.&nbsp; The people of the house informed me that the
nuts were intended for exportation, and that they never dreamt
either of partaking of them themselves or of offering them to
their guests.</p>
<p>At an early hour on the following day we reached Colunga, a
beautiful village on a rising ground, thickly planted with
chestnut trees.&nbsp; It is celebrated, at least in the Asturias,
as being the birthplace of Argu&euml;lles, the father of the
Spanish constitution.</p>
<p>As we dismounted at the door of the <i>posada</i>, where we
intended to refresh ourselves, a person who was leaning out of an
upper window uttered an exclamation and disappeared.&nbsp; We
were yet at the door, when the same individual came running forth
and cast himself on the neck of Antonio.&nbsp; He was a
good-looking <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>young man, apparently about five-and-twenty, genteelly
dressed, with a <i>montero</i> cap on his head.&nbsp; Antonio
looked at him for a moment, and then with an &ldquo;<i>Ah</i>,
<i>Monsieur</i>, <i>est ce bien vous</i>?&rdquo; shook him
affectionately by the hand.&nbsp; The stranger then motioned him
to follow him, and they forthwith proceeded to the room
above.</p>
<p>Wondering what this could mean, I sat down to my morning
repast.&nbsp; Nearly an hour elapsed, and still Antonio did not
make his appearance.&nbsp; Through the boards, however, which
composed the ceiling of the kitchen where I sat, I could hear the
voices of himself and his acquaintance, and thought that I could
occasionally distinguish the sound of broken sobs and
groans.&nbsp; At last there was a long pause.&nbsp; I became
impatient, and was about to summon Antonio, when he made his
appearance, but unaccompanied by the stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;What,
in the name of all that is singular,&rdquo; I demanded,
&ldquo;have you been about?&nbsp; Who is that man?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio,
&ldquo;<i>c&rsquo;est un monsieur de ma connaissance</i>.&nbsp;
With your permission I will now take a mouthful, and as we
journey along I will tell you all that I know of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Monsieur</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio, as we rode out of
Colunga, &ldquo;you are anxious to know the history of the
gentleman whom you saw embrace me at the inn.&nbsp; Know, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>, that these Carlist and <i>Cristino</i> wars
have been the cause of much misery and misfortune in this
country; but a being so thoroughly unfortunate as that poor young
gentleman of the inn, I do not believe is to be found in Spain,
and his misfortunes proceed entirely from the spirit of party and
faction which for some time past has been so prevalent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, as I have often told you, I
have lived <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>in many houses and served many masters, and it chanced
that about ten years ago I served the father of this gentleman,
who was then a mere boy.&nbsp; It was a very high family, for
<i>monsieur</i> the father was a general in the army, and a man
of large possessions.&nbsp; The family consisted of the general,
his lady, and two sons; the youngest of whom is the person you
have just seen, the other was several years older.&nbsp;
<i>Pardieu</i>!&nbsp; I felt myself very comfortable in that
house, and every individual of the family had all kind of
complaisance for me.&nbsp; It is singular enough, that though I
have been turned out of so many families, I was never turned out
of that; and though I left it thrice, it was of my own free
will.&nbsp; I became dissatisfied with the other servants, or
with the dog or the cat.&nbsp; The last time I left was on
account of the quail which was hung out of the window of
<i>madame</i>, and which waked me in the morning with its
call.&nbsp; <i>Eh bien</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, things went
on in this way during the three years that I continued in the
family, out and in; at the end of which time it was determined
that the young gentleman should travel, and it was proposed that
I should attend him as valet.&nbsp; This I wished very much to
do.&nbsp; However, <i>par malheur</i>, I was at this time very
much dissatisfied with <i>madame</i> his mother about the quail,
and insisted that before I accompanied him the bird should be
slaughtered for the kitchen.&nbsp; To this <i>madame</i> would by
no means consent; and even the young gentleman, who had always
taken my part on other occasions, said that I was unreasonable:
so I left the house in a huff, and never entered it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, the young
gentleman went upon his travels, and continued abroad several
years; and from the time of his departure until we met him <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>at Colunga, I
have not set eyes upon, nor indeed heard of him.&nbsp; I have
heard enough, however, of his family; of <i>monsieur</i> the
father, of <i>madame</i>, and of the brother, who was an officer
of cavalry.&nbsp; A short time before the troubles, I mean before
the death of Ferdinand, <i>monsieur</i> the father was appointed
captain-general of Corunna.&nbsp; Now <i>monsieur</i>, though a
good master, was rather a proud man, and fond of discipline, and
all that kind of thing, and of obedience.&nbsp; He was, moreover,
no friend to the populace, to the <i>canaille</i>, and he had a
particular aversion to the nationals.&nbsp; So, when Ferdinand
died, it was whispered about at Corunna that the general was no
liberal, and that he was a better friend to Carlos than
Christina.&nbsp; <i>Eh bien</i>, it chanced that there was a
grand <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, or festival, at Corunna, on the water,
and the nationals were there, and the soldiers.&nbsp; And I know
not how it befell, but there was an <i>&eacute;meute</i>, and the
nationals laid hands on <i>monsieur</i> the general, and tying a
rope round his neck, flung him overboard from the barge in which
he was, and then dragged him astern about the harbour until he
was drowned.&nbsp; They then went to his house, and pillaged it,
and so ill-treated <i>madame</i>, who at that time happened to be
<i>enceinte</i>, that in a few hours she expired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, when I heard
of the misfortune of <i>madame</i> and the general, you would
scarcely believe it, but I actually shed tears, and was sorry
that I had parted with them in unkindness on account of that
pernicious quail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, <i>nous
poursuivrons notre histoire</i>.&nbsp; The eldest son, as I told
you before, was a cavalry officer, and a man of resolution, and
when he heard of the death of his father and mother, he vowed <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>revenge.&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp; So what does he do but
desert, with two or three discontented spirits of his troop, and
going to the frontier of Galicia, he raised a small faction, and
proclaimed Don Carlos.&nbsp; For some little time he did
considerable damage to the liberals, burning and destroying their
possessions, and putting to death several nationals that fell
into his hands.&nbsp; However, this did not last long; his
faction was soon dispersed, and he himself taken and hanged, and
his head stuck on a pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nous sommes d&eacute;j&agrave; presque au
bout</i>.&nbsp; When we arrived at the inn, the young man took me
above, as you saw, and there for some time he could do nothing
but weep and sob.&nbsp; His story is soon told:&mdash;he returned
from his travels, and the first intelligence which awaited him on
his arrival in Spain was, that his father was drowned, his mother
dead, and his brother hanged, and, moreover, all the possessions
of his family confiscated.&nbsp; This was not all: wherever he
went, he found himself considered in the light of a factious and
discontented person, and was frequently assailed by the nationals
with blows of sabres and cudgels.&nbsp; He applied to his
relations, and some of these, who were of the Carlist persuasion,
advised him to betake himself to the army of Don Carlos, and the
Pretender himself, who was a friend of his father, and remembered
the services of his brother, offered to give him a command in his
army.&nbsp; But, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, as I told you before,
he was a pacific young gentleman, and as mild as a lamb, and
hated the idea of shedding blood.&nbsp; He was, moreover, not of
the Carlist opinion, for during his studies he had read books
written a long time ago by countrymen of mine, all about
republics and liberties, and the rights of man, so that he was <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>much more
inclined to the liberal than the Carlist system; he therefore
declined the offer of Don Carlos, whereupon all his relations
deserted him, whilst the liberals hunted him from one place to
another like a wild beast.&nbsp; At last, he sold some little
property which still remained to him, and with the proceeds he
came to this remote place of Colunga, where no one knew him, and
where he has been residing for several months, in a most
melancholy manner, with no other amusement than that which he
derives from a book or two, or occasionally hunting a leveret
with his spaniel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me for counsel, but I had none to give him,
and could only weep with him.&nbsp; At last he said, &lsquo;Dear
Antonio, I see there is no remedy.&nbsp; You say your master is
below; beg him, I pray, to stay till tomorrow, and we will send
for the maidens of the neighbourhood, and for a violin and
bagpipe, and we will dance and cast away care for a
moment.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he said something in old Greek,
which I scarcely understood, but which I think was equivalent to,
&lsquo;Let us eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we
die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, I told him
that you were a serious gentleman, who never took any amusement,
and that you were in a hurry.&nbsp; Whereupon he wept again, and
embraced me, and bade me farewell.&nbsp; And now, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>, I have told you the history of the young man of
the inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We slept at Ribida de Sella, and the next day at noon arrived
at Llanes.&nbsp; Our route lay between the coast and an immense
range of mountains, which rose up like huge ramparts at about a
league&rsquo;s distance from the sea.&nbsp; The ground over which
we passed was tolerably level, and seemingly well
cultivated.&nbsp; There was no lack of vines and trees, whilst at
short intervals <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>rose the <i>cortijos</i> of the proprietors&mdash;square
stone buildings surrounded with an outer wall.&nbsp; Llanes is an
old town, formerly of considerable strength.&nbsp; In its
neighbourhood is the convent of San Cilorio, one of the largest
monastic edifices in all Spain.&nbsp; It is now deserted, and
stands alone and desolate upon one of the peninsulas of the
Cantabrian shore.&nbsp; Leaving Llanes, we soon entered one of
the most dreary and barren regions imaginable, a region of rock
and stone, where neither grass nor trees were to be seen.&nbsp;
Night overtook us in these places.&nbsp; We wandered on, however,
until we reached a small village, termed Santo Colombo.&nbsp;
Here we passed the night, in the house of a carabineer of the
revenue, a tall athletic figure, who met us at the gate, armed
with a gun.&nbsp; He was a Castilian, and with all that
ceremonious formality and grave politeness for which his
countrymen were at one time so celebrated.&nbsp; He chid his wife
for conversing with her handmaid about the concerns of the house
before us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Barbara,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is
not conversation calculated to interest the strange cavaliers;
hold your peace, or go aside with the
<i>muchacha</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the morning he refused any
remuneration for his hospitality, &ldquo;I am a
<i>caballero</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;even as
yourselves.&nbsp; It is not my custom to admit people into my
house for the sake of lucre.&nbsp; I received you because you
were benighted and the <i>posada</i> distant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising early in the morning, we pursued our way through a
country equally stony and dreary as that which we had entered
upon the preceding day.&nbsp; In about four hours we reached San
Vicente, a large and dilapidated town, chiefly inhabited by
miserable fishermen.&nbsp; It retains, however, many remarkable
relics of former magnificence: the bridge, which bestrides the <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>broad and
deep firth on which stands the town, has no less than thirty-two
arches, and is built of grey granite.&nbsp; It is very ancient,
and in some parts in so ruinous a condition as to be
dangerous.</p>
<p>Leaving San Vicente behind us, we travelled for some leagues
on the seashore, crossing occasionally a narrow inlet or
firth.&nbsp; The country at last began to improve, and in the
neighbourhood of Santillana was both beautiful and fertile.&nbsp;
About a league before we reached the country of Gil Blas we
passed through an extensive wood, in which were rocks and
precipices; it was exactly such a place as that in which the cave
of Rolando was situated, as described in the novel.&nbsp; The
wood has an evil name, and our guide informed us that robberies
were occasionally committed in it.&nbsp; No adventure, however,
befell us, and we reached Santillana at about six in the
evening.</p>
<p>We did not enter the town, but halted at a large <i>venta</i>,
or <i>posada</i>, at the entrance, before which stood an immense
ash tree.&nbsp; We had scarcely housed ourselves when a
tremendous storm of rain and wind commenced, accompanied with
thunder and lightning, which continued without much interruption
for several hours, and the effects of which were visible in our
journey of the following day, the streams over which we passed
being much swollen, and several trees lying uptorn by the
wayside.&nbsp; Santillana contains four thousand inhabitants, and
is six short leagues&rsquo; distance from Santander, where we
arrived early the next day.</p>
<p>Nothing could exhibit a stronger contrast to the desolate
tracts and the half-ruined towns through which we had lately
passed, than the bustle and activity of Santander, which, though
it stands on the confines of the Basque provinces, the stronghold
of the Pretender, <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>is almost the only city in Spain which has not suffered
by the Carlist wars.&nbsp; Till the close of the last century it
was little better than an obscure fishing town, but it has of
late years almost entirely engrossed the commerce of the Spanish
transatlantic possessions, especially of the Havannah.&nbsp; The
consequence of which has been, that whilst Santander has rapidly
increased in wealth and magnificence, both Corunna and Cadiz have
been as rapidly hastening to decay.&nbsp; At present it possesses
a noble quay, on which stands a line of stately edifices, far
exceeding in splendour the palaces of the aristocracy of
Madrid.&nbsp; These are built in the French style, and are
chiefly occupied by the merchants.&nbsp; The population of
Santander is estimated at sixty thousand souls.</p>
<p>On the day of my arrival I dined at the
<i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> of the principal inn, kept by a
Genoese.&nbsp; The company was very miscellaneous&mdash;French,
Germans, and Spaniards, all speaking in their respective
languages, whilst at the ends of the table, confronting each
other, sat two Catalan merchants, one of whom weighed nearly
twenty stone, grunting across the board in their harsh
dialect.&nbsp; Long, however, before dinner was concluded the
conversation was entirely engrossed and the attention of all
present directed to an individual who sat on one side of the
bulky Catalan.&nbsp; He was a thin man of about the middle
height, with a remarkably red face, and something in his eyes
which, if not a squint, bore a striking resemblance to it.&nbsp;
He was dressed in a blue military frock, and seemed to take much
more pleasure in haranguing than in the fare which was set before
him.&nbsp; He spoke perfectly good Spanish, yet his voice
betrayed something of a foreign accent.&nbsp; For a long time he
descanted with immense <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>volubility on war and all its
circumstances, freely criticizing the conduct of the generals,
both Carlist and <i>Cristinos</i>, in the present struggle, till
at last he exclaimed, &ldquo;Had I but twenty thousand men
allowed me by the government, I would bring the war to a
conclusion in six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said a Spaniard who sat at the
table, &ldquo;the curiosity which induces me to request the
favour of your distinguished name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Flinter,&rdquo; replied the individual in the
military frock, &ldquo;a name which is in the mouth of every man,
woman, and child in Spain.&nbsp; I am Flinter <a
name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a> the Irishman, just escaped from the
Basque provinces and the claws of Don Carlos.&nbsp; On the
decease of Ferdinand, I declared for Isabella, esteeming it the
duty of every good cavalier and Irishman in the Spanish service
to do so.&nbsp; You have all heard of my exploits, and permit me
to tell you they would have been yet more glorious had not
jealousy been at work and cramped my means.&nbsp; Two years ago I
was despatched to Estremadura, to organize the militias.&nbsp;
The bands of Gomez and Cabrera entered the province, and spread
devastation around.&nbsp; They found me, however, at my post; and
had I been properly seconded by those under my command, the two
rebels would never have returned to their master to boast of
their success.&nbsp; I stood behind my intrenchments.&nbsp; A man
advanced and summoned us to <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>surrender.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who are
you?&rsquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am Cabrera,&rsquo; he
replied; &lsquo;and I am Flinter,&rsquo; I retorted flourishing
my sabre; &lsquo;retire to your battalions, or you will forthwith
die the death.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was awed, and did as I
commanded.&nbsp; In an hour we surrendered.&nbsp; I was led a
prisoner to the Basque provinces; and the Carlists rejoiced in
the capture they had made, for the name of Flinter had long
sounded amongst the Carlist ranks.&nbsp; I was flung into a
loathsome dungeon, where I remained twenty months.&nbsp; I was
cold; I was naked; but I did not on that account despond&mdash;my
spirit was too indomitable for such weakness.&nbsp; My keeper at
last pitied my misfortunes.&nbsp; He said that &lsquo;it grieved
him to see so valiant a man perish in inglorious
confinement.&rsquo;&nbsp; We laid a plan to escape together;
disguises were provided, and we made the attempt.&nbsp; We passed
unobserved till we arrived at the Carlist lines above Bilbao:
there we were stopped.&nbsp; My presence of mind, however, did
not desert me.&nbsp; I was disguised as a carman, as a Catalan,
and the coolness of my answers deceived my interrogators.&nbsp;
We were permitted to pass, and soon were safe within the walls of
Bilbao.&nbsp; There was an illumination that night in the town,
for the lion had burst his toils, Flinter had escaped, and was
once more returned to reanimate a drooping cause.&nbsp; I have
just arrived at Santander, on my way to Madrid, where I intend to
ask of the government a command, with twenty thousand
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Flinter! a braver heart and a more gasconading mouth were
surely never united in the same body.&nbsp; He proceeded to
Madrid, and through the influence of the British ambassador, who
was his friend, he obtained the command of a small division, with
which <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>he
contrived to surprise and defeat, in the neighbourhood of Toledo,
a body of the Carlists, commanded by Orejita, whose numbers more
than trebled his own.&nbsp; In reward for this exploit he was
persecuted by the government, which, at that time, was the
<i>moderado</i> or <i>juste milieu</i>, with the most relentless
animosity; the prime minister, Ofalia, supporting with all his
influence numerous and ridiculous accusations of plunder and
robbery brought against the too successful general by the Carlist
canons of Toledo.&nbsp; He was likewise charged with a
dereliction of duty, in having permitted, after the battle of
Valdepe&ntilde;as, which he likewise won in the most gallant
manner, the Carlist force to take possession of the mines of
Almaden, although the government, who were bent on his ruin, had
done all in their power to prevent him from following up his
successes, by denying him the slightest supplies and
reinforcements.&nbsp; The fruits of victory thus wrested from
him, his hopes blighted, a morbid melancholy seized upon the
Irishman; he resigned his command, and, in less than ten months
from the period when I saw him at Santander, afforded his
dastardly and malignant enemies a triumph which satisfied even
them, by cutting his own throat with a razor.</p>
<p>Ardent spirits of foreign climes, who hope to distinguish
yourselves in the service of Spain, and to earn honours and
rewards, remember the fate of Columbus, and of another as brave
and as ardent&mdash;Flinter!</p>

95</span>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Departure from Santander&mdash;The Night
Alarm&mdash;The Black Pass.</p>
<p>I had ordered two hundred Testaments to be sent to Santander
from Madrid: I found, however, to my great sorrow, that they had
not arrived, and I supposed that they had either been seized on
the way by the Carlists, or that my letter had miscarried.&nbsp;
I then thought of applying to England for a supply, but I
abandoned the idea for two reasons.&nbsp; In the first place, I
should have to remain idly loitering, at least a month, before I
could receive them, at a place where every article was
excessively dear; and, secondly, I was very unwell, and unable to
procure medical advice at Santander.&nbsp; Ever since I left
Corunna, I had been afflicted with a terrible dysentery, and
latterly with an ophthalmia, the result of the other
malady.&nbsp; I therefore determined on returning to
Madrid.&nbsp; To effect this, however, seemed no very easy
task.&nbsp; Parties of the army of Don Carlos, which, in a
partial degree, had been routed in Castile, were hovering about
the country through which I should have to pass, more especially
in that part called &ldquo;The Mountains,&rdquo; so that all
communication had ceased between Santander and the southern
districts.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I determined to trust <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>as usual in
the Almighty, and to risk the danger.&nbsp; I purchased,
therefore, a small horse, and sallied forth with Antonio.</p>
<p>Before departing, however, I entered into conference with the
booksellers as to what they should do in the event of my finding
an opportunity of sending them a stock of Testaments from Madrid;
and, having arranged matters to my satisfaction, I committed
myself to Providence.&nbsp; I will not dwell long on this journey
of three hundred miles.&nbsp; We were in the midst of the fire,
yet, strange to say, escaped without a hair of our heads being
singed.&nbsp; Robberies, murders, and all kinds of atrocities
were perpetrated before, behind, and on both sides of us; but not
so much as a dog barked at us, though in one instance a plan had
been laid to intercept us.&nbsp; About four leagues from
Santander, whilst we were baiting our horses at a village
hostelry, I saw a fellow run off after having held a whispering
conversation with a boy who was dealing out barley to us.&nbsp; I
instantly inquired of the latter what the man had said to him,
but only obtained an evasive answer.&nbsp; It appeared afterwards
that the conversation was about ourselves.&nbsp; Two or three
leagues farther there was an inn and village where we had
proposed staying, and indeed had expressed our intention of doing
so; but on arriving there, finding that the sun was still far
from its bourne, I determined to proceed farther, expecting to
meet with a resting-place at the distance of a league; though I
was mistaken, as we found none until we reached Montaneda, nine
leagues and a half from Santander, where was stationed a small
detachment of soldiers.&nbsp; At the dead of night, we were
aroused from our sleep by a cry that the &ldquo;factious&rdquo;
were not far off.&nbsp; A messenger had arrived from the
<i>alcalde</i> <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>of the village where we had previously intended staying,
who stated that a party of Carlists had just surprised that
place, and were searching for an English spy, whom they supposed
to be at the inn.&nbsp; The officer commanding the soldiers, upon
hearing this, not deeming his own situation a safe one, instantly
drew off his men, falling back on a stronger party stationed in a
fortified village near at hand.&nbsp; As for ourselves, we
saddled our horses and continued our way in the dark.&nbsp; Had
the Carlists succeeded in apprehending me, I should instantly
have been shot, and my body cast on the rocks to feed the
vultures and wolves.&nbsp; But &ldquo;it was not so
written,&rdquo; said Antonio, who, like many of his countrymen,
was a fatalist.&nbsp; The next night we had another singular
escape: we had arrived near the entrance of a horrible pass
called &ldquo;<i>El puerto de la puente de las tablas</i>,&rdquo;
or the pass of the bridge of planks, which wound through a black
and frightful mountain, on the farther side of which was the town
of O&ntilde;as, where we meant to tarry for the night.&nbsp; The
sun had set about a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Suddenly a man,
with his face covered with blood, rushed out of the pass.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Turn back, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the name of God;
there are murderers in that pass; they have just robbed me of my
mule, and all I possess, and I have hardly escaped with life from
their hands!&rdquo;&nbsp; I scarcely know why, but I made him no
answer, and proceeded; indeed I was so weary and unwell that I
cared not what became of me.&nbsp; We entered; the rocks rose
perpendicularly, right and left, entirely intercepting the scanty
twilight, so that the darkness of the grave, or rather the
blackness of the valley of the shadow of death, reigned around
us, and we knew not where we went, but trusted to the instinct of
the horses, who <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>moved on with their heads close to the ground.&nbsp; The
only sound which we heard was the plash of a stream, which
tumbled down the pass.&nbsp; I expected every moment to feel a
knife at my throat, but &ldquo;<i>it was not so
written</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We threaded the pass without meeting a
human being, and within three-quarters of an hour after the time
we entered it, we found ourselves within the <i>posada</i> of the
town of O&ntilde;as, which was filled with troops and armed
peasants expecting an attack from the grand Carlist army, which
was near at hand.</p>
<p>Well, we reached Burgos in safety; <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a> we reached
Valladolid in safety; we passed the Guadarrama in safety; and
were at length safely housed in Madrid.&nbsp; People said we had
been very lucky; Antonio said, &ldquo;It was so written;&rdquo;
but I say, Glory be to the Lord for His mercies vouchsafed to
us.</p>

<p>During my journey in the northern provinces of Spain, which
occupied a considerable portion of the year 1837, I had
accomplished but a slight portion of what I proposed to myself to
effect in the outset.&nbsp; Insignificant are the results of
man&rsquo;s labours compared with the swelling ideas of his
presumption; something, however, had been effected by the journey
which I had just concluded.&nbsp; The New Testament of Christ was
now enjoying a quiet sale in the principal towns of the north,
and I had secured the friendly interest and co-operation of the
booksellers of those parts, particularly of him the most
considerable of them all, old Rey of Compostella.&nbsp; I had,
moreover, disposed of a considerable number of Testaments with my
own hands, to private individuals, entirely of the lower classes,
namely, muleteers, carmen, <i>contrabandistas</i>, etc., so that
upon the whole I had abundant cause for gratitude and
thanksgiving.</p>
<p>I did not find our affairs in a very prosperous state <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>at Madrid,
few copies having been sold in the booksellers&rsquo; shops; yet
what could be rationally expected during these latter
times?&nbsp; Don Carlos, with a large army, had been at the
gates; plunder and massacre had been expected; so that people
were too much occupied in forming plans to secure their lives and
property to give much attention to reading of any
description.</p>
<p>The enemy, however, had now retired to his strongholds in
Alava and Guipuzcoa.&nbsp; I hoped that brighter days were
dawning, and that the work, under my own superintendence, would,
with God&rsquo;s blessing, prosper in the capital of Spain.&nbsp;
How far the result corresponded with my expectations will be seen
in the sequel.</p>
<p>During my absence in the north, a total change of ministers
had occurred.&nbsp; The liberal party had been ousted from the
cabinet, and in their place had entered individuals attached to
the <i>moderado</i> or court party: unfortunately, however, for
my prospects, they consisted of persons with whom I had no
acquaintance whatever, and with whom my former friends, Galiano
and Isturitz, had little or no influence.&nbsp; These gentlemen
were now regularly laid on the shelf, and their political career
appeared to be terminated for ever. <a name="citation100"></a><a
href="#footnote100" class="citation">[100]</a></p>
<p>From the present ministry I could expect but little; they
consisted of men the greater part of whom had been either
courtiers or employ&eacute;s of the deceased King Ferdinand, who
were friends to absolutism, and by no means inclined to do or to
favour anything calculated to give offence to the court of Rome,
which they were anxious to conciliate, hoping that eventually it
might be induced to recognize the young queen, not as the <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>constitutional but as the absolute Queen Isabella the
Second.</p>
<p>Such was the party which continued in power throughout the
remainder of my sojourn in Spain, and which persecuted me less
from rancour and malice than from policy.&nbsp; It was not until
the conclusion of the war of the succession that it lost the
ascendency, when it sank to the ground with its patroness the
queen-mother, before the dictatorship of Espartero.</p>
<p>The first step which I took after my return to Madrid, towards
circulating the Scriptures, was a very bold one.&nbsp; It was
neither more nor less than the establishment of a shop for the
sale of Testaments.&nbsp; This shop was situated in the Calle del
Principe, a respectable and well-frequented street in the
neighbourhood of the Square of Cervantes.&nbsp; I furnished it
handsomely with glass cases and chandeliers, and procured an
acute Gallegan of the name of Pepe Calzado, to superintend the
business, who gave me weekly a faithful account of the copies
sold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strangely times alter,&rdquo; said I, the second
day subsequent to the opening of my establishment, as I stood on
the opposite side of the street, leaning against the wall with
folded arms, surveying my shop, on the windows of which were
painted in large yellow characters, <i>Despacho de la Sociedad
B&iacute;blica y Estrangera</i>; <a name="citation101"></a><a
href="#footnote101" class="citation">[101]</a> &ldquo;how
strangely times alter!&nbsp; Here have I been during the last
eight months running about old Popish Spain, distributing
Testaments, as agent of what the Papists call an heretical
society, and have neither been stoned nor burnt; and here am I
now in the capital, doing that which one would think were enough
to cause all <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>the dead inquisitors and officials buried within the
circuit of the walls to rise from their graves and cry
abomination; and yet no one interferes with me.&nbsp; Pope of
Rome!&nbsp; Pope of Rome! look to thyself.&nbsp; That shop may be
closed; but oh! what a sign of the times, that it has been
permitted to exist for one day.&nbsp; It appears to me, my
Father, that the days of your sway are numbered in Spain; that
you will not be permitted much longer to plunder her, to scoff at
her, and to scourge her with scorpions, as in bygone
periods.&nbsp; See I not the hand on the wall?&nbsp; See I not in
yonder letters a &lsquo;<i>Mene</i>, <i>Mene</i>, <i>Tekel</i>,
<i>Upharsin</i>&rsquo;?&nbsp; Look to thyself,
<i>Batuschca</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I remained for two hours, leaning against the wall,
staring at the shop.</p>
<p>A short time after the establishment of the <i>despacho</i> at
Madrid, I once more mounted the saddle, and, attended by Antonio,
rode over to Toledo, for the purpose of circulating the
Scriptures, sending beforehand by a muleteer a cargo of one
hundred Testaments.&nbsp; I instantly addressed myself to the
principal bookseller of the place, whom, from the circumstance of
his living in a town so abounding with canons, priests, and
ex-friars as Toledo, I expected to find a Carlist, or a
<i>servil</i> at least.&nbsp; I was never more mistaken in my
life: on entering the shop, which was very large and commodious,
I beheld a stout athletic man, dressed in a kind of cavalry
uniform, with a helmet on his head, and an immense sabre in his
hand.&nbsp; This was the bookseller himself, who, I soon found,
was an officer in the national cavalry.&nbsp; Upon learning who I
was, he shook me heartily by the hand, and said that nothing
would give him greater pleasure than taking charge of the books,
which he <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>would endeavour to circulate to the utmost of his
ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will not your doing so bring you into odium with the
clergy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ca</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation103a"></a><a
href="#footnote103a" class="citation">[103a]</a> said he;
&ldquo;who cares?&nbsp; I am rich, and so was my father before
me.&nbsp; I do not depend on them; they cannot hate me more than
they do already, for I make no secret of my opinions.&nbsp; I
have just returned from an expedition,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my
brother nationals and myself have, for the last three days, been
occupied in hunting down the factious and thieves of the
neighbourhood; we have killed three and brought in several
prisoners.&nbsp; Who cares for the cowardly priests?&nbsp; I am a
liberal, <i>Don Jorge</i>, and a friend of your countryman,
Flinter.&nbsp; Many is the Carlist guerilla-curate and
robber-friar whom I have assisted him to catch.&nbsp; I am
rejoiced to hear that he has just been appointed captain-general
of Toledo; there will be fine doings here when he arrives, <i>Don
Jorge</i>.&nbsp; We will make the clergy shake between us, I
assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toledo was formerly the capital of Spain.&nbsp; Its population
at present is barely fifteen thousand souls, though, in the time
of the Romans, and also during the Middle Ages, it is said to
have amounted to between two and three hundred thousand.&nbsp; It
is situated about twelve leagues, or forty miles, westward <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a> of Madrid, and is built upon a steep
rocky hill, round which flows the Tagus, on all sides but the
north.&nbsp; It still possesses a great many remarkable edifices,
notwithstanding that it has long since fallen into decay.&nbsp;
Its cathedral is the most magnificent of Spain, and is the see of
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the
primate.&nbsp; In the tower of this cathedral is the famous bell
of Toledo, the largest in the world with the exception of the
monster bell of Moscow, which I have also seen.&nbsp; It weighs
1543 <i>arrobas</i>, or 37,032 pounds.&nbsp; It has, however, a
disagreeable sound, owing to a cleft in its side.&nbsp; Toledo
could once boast the finest pictures in Spain, but many were
stolen or destroyed by the French during the Peninsular war, and
still more have lately been removed by order of the
government.&nbsp; Perhaps the most remarkable one still remains;
I allude to that which represents the burial of the Count of
Orgas, the masterpiece of Domenico, <a name="citation104"></a><a
href="#footnote104" class="citation">[104]</a> the Greek, a most
extraordinary genius, some of whose productions possess merit of
a very high order.&nbsp; The picture in question is in the little
parish church of San Tom&eacute;, at the bottom of the aisle, on
the left side of the altar.&nbsp; Could it be purchased, I should
say it would be cheap at five thousand pounds.</p>
<p>Amongst the many remarkable things which meet the eye of the
curious observer at Toledo, is the manufactory of arms, where are
wrought the swords, spears, and other weapons intended for the
army, with the exception of firearms, which mostly come from
abroad.</p>
<p>In old times, as is well known, the sword-blades of Toledo
were held in great estimation, and were transmitted as
merchandise throughout Christendom.&nbsp; The <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>present
manufactory, or <i>fabrica</i>, as it is called, is a handsome
modern edifice, situated without the wall of the city, on a plain
contiguous to the river, with which it communicates by a small
canal.&nbsp; It is said that the water and the sand of the Tagus
are essential for the proper tempering of the swords.&nbsp; I
asked some of the principal workmen whether, at the present day,
they could manufacture weapons of equal value to those of former
days, and whether the secret had been lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ca</i>!&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;the swords of
Toledo were never so good as those which we are daily
making.&nbsp; It is ridiculous enough to see strangers coming
here to purchase old swords, the greater part of which are mere
rubbish, and never made at Toledo, yet for such they will give a
large price, whilst they would grudge two dollars for this jewel,
which was made but yesterday;&rdquo; thereupon putting into my
hand a middle-sized rapier.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your worship,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;seems to have a strong arm; prove its temper
against the stone wall&mdash;thrust boldly and fear
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I <i>have</i> a strong arm, and dashed the point with my
utmost force against the solid granite: my arm was numbed to the
shoulder from the violence of the concussion, and continued so
for nearly a week, but the sword appeared not to be at all
blunted, or to have suffered in any respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A better sword than that,&rdquo; said an ancient
workman, a native of Old Castile, &ldquo;never transfixed Moor
out yonder on the <i>sagra</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During my stay at Toledo, I lodged at the Posada de los
Caballeros, which signifies the inn of the gentlemen, which name,
in some respects, it certainly well deserved, for there are many
palaces far less magnificent than this inn of Toledo.&nbsp; By
magnificence it <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>must not be supposed, however, that I allude to
costliness of furniture or any kind of luxury which pervaded the
culinary department.&nbsp; The rooms were as empty as those of
Spanish inns generally are, and the fare, though good in its
kind, was plain and homely; but I have seldom seen a more
imposing edifice.&nbsp; It was of immense size, consisting of
several stories, and was built something in the Moorish taste,
with a quadrangular court in the centre, beneath which was an
immense <i>algibe</i> or tank, serving as a reservoir for
rain-water.&nbsp; All the houses in Toledo are supplied with
tanks of this description, into which the waters in the rainy
season flow from the roofs through pipes.&nbsp; No other water is
used for drinking; that of the Tagus, not being considered
salubrious, is only used for purposes of cleanliness, being
conveyed up the steep narrow streets on donkeys, in large stone
jars.&nbsp; The city, standing on a rocky mountain, has no
wells.&nbsp; As for the rain-water, it deposits a sediment in the
tank, and becomes very sweet and potable: these tanks are cleaned
out twice every year.&nbsp; During the summer, at which time the
heat in this part of Spain is intense, the families spend the
greater part of the day in the courts, which are overhung with a
linen awning, the heat of the atmosphere being tempered by the
coolness arising from the tank below, which answers the same
purpose as the fountain in the southern provinces of Spain.</p>
<p>I spent about a week at Toledo, during which time several
copies of the Testament were disposed of in the shop of my friend
the bookseller.&nbsp; Several priests took it up from the
<i>mostrador</i> on which it lay, examined it, but made no
remarks; none of them purchased it.&nbsp; My friend showed me
through his house, <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>almost every apartment of which was lined from roof to
floor with books, many of which were highly valuable.&nbsp; He
told me that he possessed the best collection in Spain of the
ancient literature of the country.&nbsp; He was, however, less
proud of his library than his stud; finding that I had some
acquaintance with horses, his liking for me and also his respect
considerably increased.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I have,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is at your service; I see you are a man after my own
heart.&nbsp; When you are disposed to ride out upon the
<i>sagra</i>, you have only to apply to my groom, who will
forthwith saddle you my famed Cordovese <i>entero</i>; I
purchased him from the stables at Aranjuez, when the royal stud
was broken up.&nbsp; There is but one other man to whom I would
lend him, and that man is Flinter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Toledo I met with a forlorn gypsy woman and her son, a lad
of about fourteen years of age; she was not a native of the
place, but had come from La Mancha, her husband having been cast
into the prison of Toledo on a charge of mule-stealing: the crime
had been proved against him, and in a few days he was to depart
for Malaga, with the chain of galley-slaves.&nbsp; He was quite
destitute of money, and his wife was now in Toledo, earning a few
<i>cuartos</i> by telling fortunes about the streets, to support
him in prison.&nbsp; She told me that it was her intention to
follow him to Malaga, where she hoped to be able to effect his
escape.&nbsp; What an instance of conjugal affection! and yet the
affection here was all on one side, as is too frequently the
case.&nbsp; Her husband was a worthless scoundrel, who had
previously abandoned her and betaken himself to Madrid, where he
had long lived in concubinage with the notorious she-thug Aurora,
<a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a> at <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>whose instigation he had committed
the robbery for which he was now held in durance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Should your husband escape from Malaga, in what direction
will he fly?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the <i>chim</i> of the <i>Corahai</i>, my son; to
the land of the Moors, to be a soldier of the Moorish
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will become of yourself?&rdquo; I inquired;
&ldquo;think you that he will take you with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will leave me on the shore, my son; and as soon as
he has crossed the black <i>pawnee</i>, he will forget me and
never think of me more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And knowing his ingratitude, why should you give
yourself so much trouble about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not his <i>rom&iacute;</i>, my son; and am I not
bound by the law of the <i>Cal&eacute;s</i> to assist him to the
last?&nbsp; Should he return from the land of the <i>Corahai</i>
at the end of a hundred years, and should find me alive, and
should say, &lsquo;I am hungry, little wife; go forth and steal
or tell <i>baji</i>,&rsquo; I must do it, for he is the
<i>rom</i> and I the <i>rom&iacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my return to Madrid, I found the <i>despacho</i> still
open.&nbsp; Various Testaments had been sold, though the number
was by no means considerable: the work had to labour under great
disadvantage, from the ignorance of the people at large with
respect to its tenor and contents.&nbsp; It was no wonder, then,
that little interest was felt respecting it.&nbsp; To call,
however, public attention to the <i>despacho</i>, I printed three
thousand advertisements on paper, yellow, blue, and crimson, with
which I almost covered the sides of the streets, and, besides
this, inserted an account of it in all the journals and
periodicals: the consequence was, that in a short time almost
every person in Madrid was aware <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>of its existence.&nbsp; Such
exertions in London or Paris would probably have ensured the sale
of the entire edition of the New Testament within a few
days.&nbsp; In Madrid, however, the result was not quite so
flattering; for after the establishment had been open an entire
month, the copies disposed of barely amounted to one hundred.</p>
<p>These proceedings of mine did not fail to cause a great
sensation: the priests and their partisans were teeming with
malice and fury, which, for some time, however, they thought
proper to exhibit only in words; it being their opinion that I
was favoured by the ambassador and by the British government; but
there was no attempt, however atrocious, that might not be
expected from their malignity; and were it right and seemly for
me, the most insignificant of worms, to make such a comparison, I
might say, like Paul at Ephesus, I was fighting with wild
beasts.</p>
<p>On the last day of the year 1837, my servant Antonio thus
addressed me: &ldquo;<i>Mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, it is necessary
that I leave you for a time.&nbsp; Ever since we have returned
from our journeys, I have become unsettled and dissatisfied with
the house, the furniture, and with Do&ntilde;a Marequita.&nbsp; I
have therefore engaged myself as cook in the house of the Count
of ---, where I am to receive four dollars per month less than
what your worship gives me.&nbsp; I am fond of change, though it
be for the worse.&nbsp; <i>Adieu</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>;
may you be as well served as you deserve.&nbsp; Should you
chance, however, to have any pressing need <i>de mes soins</i>,
send for me without hesitation, and I will at once give my new
master warning, if I am still with him, and come to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus I was deprived for a time of the services of <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Antonio.&nbsp; I continued for a few days without a
domestic, at the end of which time I hired a certain Cantabrian
or Basque, a native of the village of Hernani, in Guipuzcoa, who
was strongly recommended to me.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Euscarra&mdash;Basque not Irish&mdash;Sanscrit
and Tartar Dialects&mdash;A Vowel Language&mdash;Popular
Poetry&mdash;The Basques&mdash;Their Persons&mdash;Basque
Women.</p>
<p>I now entered upon the year 1838, perhaps the most eventful of
all those which I passed in Spain.&nbsp; The <i>despacho</i>
still continued open, with a somewhat increasing sale.&nbsp;
Having at this time little of particular moment with which to
occupy myself, I committed to the press two works, which for some
time past had been in the course of preparation.&nbsp; These were
the Gospel of St. Luke in the Spanish gypsy and the Euscarra
languages. <a name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a"
class="citation">[111a]</a></p>
<p>With respect to the gypsy Gospel, I have little to say, having
already spoken of it in a former work; <a
name="citation111b"></a><a href="#footnote111b"
class="citation">[111b]</a> it was translated by myself, together
with the greater part of the New Testament, during my <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>long
intercourse with the Spanish gypsies.&nbsp; Concerning the Luke
in Euscarra, however, it will be as well to be more particular,
and to avail myself of the present opportunity to say a few words
concerning the language in which it was written, and the people
for whom it was intended.</p>
<p>The Euscarra, then, is the proper term for a certain speech or
language, supposed to have been at one time prevalent throughout
Spain, but which is at present confined to certain districts,
both on the French and Spanish side of the Pyrenees, which are
laved by the waters of the Cantabrian Gulf, or Bay of
Biscay.&nbsp; This language is commonly known as the Basque, or
Biscayan, which words are mere modifications of the word
Euscarra, the consonant B having been prefixed for the sake of
euphony.&nbsp; Much that is vague, erroneous, and hypothetical
has been said and written concerning this tongue.&nbsp; The
Basques assert that it was not only the original language of
Spain, but also of the world, and that from it all other
languages are derived; but the Basques are a very ignorant
people, and know nothing of the philosophy of language.&nbsp;
Very little importance, therefore, need be attached to any
opinion of theirs on such a subject.&nbsp; A few amongst them,
however, who affect some degree of learning, contend that it is
neither more nor less than a dialect of the Ph&oelig;nician, and
that the Basques are the descendants of a Ph&oelig;nician colony,
established at the foot of the Pyrenees at a very remote
period.&nbsp; Of this theory, or rather conjecture, as it is
unsubstantiated by the slightest proof, it is needless to take
further notice than to observe that, provided the Ph&oelig;nician
language, as many of the <i>truly learned</i> have supposed, and
almost proved, was a dialect of the <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Hebrew, or closely allied to it, it
were as unreasonable to suppose that the Basque is derived from
it as that the Kamschatkan and Cherokee are dialects of the Greek
and Latin.</p>
<p>There is, however, another opinion with respect to the Basque
which deserves more especial notice, from the circumstance of its
being extensively entertained amongst the <i>literati</i> of
various countries of Europe, more especially England.&nbsp; I
allude to the Celtic origin of this tongue, and its close
connexion with the most cultivated of all the Celtic
dialects&mdash;the Irish.&nbsp; People who pretend to be well
conversant with the subject, have even gone so far as to assert,
that so little difference exists between the Basque and Irish
tongues, that individuals of the two nations, when they meet
together, find no difficulty in understanding each other, with no
other means of communication than their respective languages; in
a word, that there is scarcely a greater difference between the
two than between the French and the Spanish Basque.&nbsp; Such
similarity, however, though so strongly insisted upon, by no
means exists in fact; and perhaps in the whole of Europe it would
be difficult to discover two languages which exhibit fewer points
of mutual resemblance than the Basque and Irish.</p>
<p>The Irish, like most other European languages, is a dialect of
the Sanscrit, a <i>remote</i> one, as may well be supposed; the
corner of the western world in which it is still preserved being,
of all countries in Europe, the most distant from the proper home
of the parent tongue.&nbsp; It is still, however, a dialect of
that venerable and most original speech, not so closely
resembling it, it is true, as the English, Danish, and those
which belong to what is called the Gothic family, and far <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>less than
those of the Sclavonian; for the nearer we approach to the East,
in equal degree the assimilation of languages to this parent
stock becomes more clear and distinct; but still a dialect,
agreeing with the Sanscrit in structure, in the arrangement of
words, and in many instances in the words themselves, which,
however modified, may still be recognized as Sanscrit.&nbsp; But
what is the Basque, and to what family does it properly
pertain?</p>
<p>To two great Asiatic languages all the dialects spoken at
present in Europe may be traced.&nbsp; These two, if not now
spoken, still exist in books, and are, moreover, the languages of
two of the principal religions of the East.&nbsp; I allude to the
Tibetian and Sanscrit&mdash;the sacred languages of the followers
of Buddh and Bramah.&nbsp; These tongues, though they possess
many words in common, which is easily to be accounted for by
their close proximity, are properly distinct, being widely
different in structure.&nbsp; In what this difference consists, I
have neither time nor inclination to state; suffice it to say,
that the Celtic, Gothic, and Sclavonian dialects in Europe belong
to the Sanscrit family, even as in the East the Persian, and to a
less degree the Arabic, Hebrew, etc.; <a
name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a> whilst to the Tibetian or Tartar
family in Asia pertain the Mandchou and Mongolian, the Calmuc and
the Turkish of the Caspian sea; and in Europe, the Hungarian and
the Basque <i>partially</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, this latter language is a strange anomaly, so that
upon the whole it is less difficult to say what it is not, than
what it is.&nbsp; It abounds with Sanscrit words <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>to such a
degree that its surface seems strewn with them.&nbsp; Yet would
it be wrong to term it a Sanscrit dialect, for in the collocation
of these words the Tartar form is most decidedly
observable.&nbsp; A considerable proportion of Tartar words is
likewise to be found in this language, though perhaps not in
equal numbers to the terms derived from the Sanscrit.&nbsp; Of
these Tartar etymons I shall at present content myself with
citing one, though, if necessary, it were easy to adduce
hundreds.&nbsp; This word is <i>Jauna</i>, or, as it is
pronounced, <i>Khauna</i>&mdash;a word in constant use amongst
the Basques, and which is the <i>Khan</i> of the Mongols and
Mandchous, and of the same signification&mdash;<i>Lord</i>.</p>
<p>Having closely examined the subject in all its various
bearings, and having weighed what is to be said on one side
against what is to be advanced on the other, I am inclined to
rank the Basque rather amongst the Tartar than the Sanscrit
dialects.&nbsp; Whoever should have an opportunity of comparing
the enunciation of the Basques and Tartars would, from that
alone, even if he understood them not, come to the conclusion
that their respective languages were formed on the same
principles.&nbsp; In both occur periods seemingly interminable,
during which the voice gradually ascends to a climax, and then
gradually sinks down.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the surprising number of Sanscrit words
contained in the Basque language, specimens of some of which will
be found below.&nbsp; It is remarkable enough, that in the
greater part of the derivatives from the Sanscrit, the Basque has
dropped the initial consonant, so that the word commences with a
vowel.&nbsp; The Basque, indeed, may be said to be almost a vowel
language, the number of consonants employed being comparatively
few; perhaps eight words out of ten <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>commence and terminate with a vowel,
owing to which it is a language to the highest degree soft and
melodious, far excelling in this respect any other language in
Europe, not even excepting the Italian.&nbsp; Here follow a few
specimens of Basque words with the Sanscrit roots in
juxtaposition:&mdash;</p>

<p>Such is the tongue in which I brought out Saint Luke&rsquo;s
Gospel at Madrid.&nbsp; The translation I procured originally
from a Basque physician of the name of Oteiza. <a
name="citation116b"></a><a href="#footnote116b"
class="citation">[116b]</a>&nbsp; Previous to being sent to the
press, the version had lain nearly two years in my possession,
during which time, and particularly during my travels, I lost no
opportunity of submitting it to the inspection of those who were
considered competent scholars in the Euscarra.&nbsp; It did not
entirely please me; but it was in vain to seek for a better
translation.</p>
<p>In my early youth I had obtained a slight acquaintance with
the Euscarra, as it exists in books.&nbsp; This acquaintance I
considerably increased during my stay in Spain, and, by
occasionally mingling with Basques, <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>was enabled to understand the spoken
language to a certain extent, and even to speak it, but always
with considerable hesitation; for to speak Basque, even
tolerably, it is necessary to have lived in the country from a
very early period.&nbsp; So great are the difficulties attending
it, and so strange are its peculiarities, that it is very rare to
find a foreigner possessed of any considerable skill in the oral
language, and the Spaniards consider the obstacles so formidable
that they have a proverb to the effect that Satan once lived
seven years in Biscay, and then departed, finding himself unable
either to understand or to make himself understood.</p>
<p>There are few inducements to the study of this language.&nbsp;
In the first place, the acquisition of it is by no means
necessary even to those who reside in the countries where it is
spoken, the Spanish being generally understood throughout the
Basque provinces pertaining to Spain, and the French in those
pertaining to France.</p>
<p>In the second place, neither dialect is in possession of any
peculiar literature capable of repaying the toil of the
student.&nbsp; There are various books extant both in French and
Spanish Basque, <a name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a> but these consist entirely of Popish
devotion, and are for the most part translations.</p>
<p>It will, perhaps, here be asked whether the Basques do not
possess popular poetry, like most other nations, however small
and inconsiderable.&nbsp; They have certainly no lack of songs,
ballads, and stanzas, but of a character by no means entitled to
the appellation of poetry.&nbsp; I have noted down from
recitation, a considerable portion of what they call their
poetry, but the only tolerable specimen of verse which I ever <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>discovered
amongst them was the following stanza, which, after all, is not
entitled to very high praise:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ichasoa urac aundi,<br />
Estu ondoric agueri&mdash;<br />
Pasaco ninsaqueni andic<br />
Maitea icustea gatic.&rdquo; <a name="citation118a"></a><a
href="#footnote118a" class="citation">[118a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;The waters of the sea are vast, and their
bottom cannot be seen; but over them I will pass, that I may
behold my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Basques are a singing rather than a poetical people.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the facility with which their tongue lends itself
to the composition of verse, they have never produced among them
a poet with the slightest pretensions to reputation; but their
voices are singularly sweet, and they are known to excel in
musical composition.&nbsp; It is the opinion of a certain author,
the Abb&eacute; D&rsquo;Iharce, <a name="citation118b"></a><a
href="#footnote118b" class="citation">[118b]</a> who has written
about them, that they derived the name <i>Cantabri</i>, by which
they are known to the Romans, from <i>Khantor-ber</i>, signifying
sweet singers.&nbsp; They possess much music of their own, some
of which is said to be exceedingly ancient.&nbsp; Of this music
specimens were published at Donostian (San Sebastian) in the year
1826, edited by a certain Juan Ignacio Iztueta. <a
name="citation118c"></a><a href="#footnote118c"
class="citation">[118c]</a>&nbsp; These consist of wild and
thrilling marches, to the sound of which it is <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>believed
that the ancient Basques were in the habit of descending from
their mountains to combat with the Romans, and subsequently with
the Moors.&nbsp; Whilst listening to them it is easy to suppose
one&rsquo;s self in the close vicinity of some desperate
encounter.&nbsp; We seem to hear the charge of cavalry on the
sounding plain, the clash of swords, and the rushing of men down
the gorges of hills.&nbsp; This music is accompanied with words,
but such words!&nbsp; Nothing can be imagined more stupid,
commonplace, and uninteresting.&nbsp; So far from being martial,
they relate to everyday incidents, and appear to have no
connexion whatever with the music.&nbsp; They are evidently of
modern date.</p>
<p>In person the Basques are of the middle size, and are active
and athletic.&nbsp; They are in general of fair complexions and
handsome features, and in appearance bear no slight resemblance
to certain Tartar tribes of the Caucasus.&nbsp; Their bravery is
unquestionable, and they are considered as the best soldiery
belonging to the Spanish crown: a fact highly corroborative of
the supposition that they are of Tartar origin, the Tartars being
of all races the most warlike, and amongst whom the most
remarkable conquerors have been produced.&nbsp; They are faithful
and honest, and capable of much disinterested attachment; kind
and hospitable to strangers; all of which points are far from
being at variance with the Tartar character.&nbsp; But they are
somewhat dull, and their capacities are by no means of a high
order, and in these respects they again resemble the Tartars.</p>
<p>No people on earth are prouder than the Basques, but theirs is
a kind of republican pride.&nbsp; They have no nobility amongst
them, and no one will acknowledge a superior.&nbsp; The poorest
carman is as proud <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>as the governor of Tolosa.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is more
powerful than I,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;but I am of as good
blood; perhaps hereafter I may become a governor
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; They abhor servitude, at least out of their
own country; and though circumstances frequently oblige them to
seek masters, it is very rare to find them filling the places of
common domestics; they are stewards, secretaries, accountants,
etc.&nbsp; True it is, that it was my own fortune to obtain a
Basque domestic; but then he always treated me more as an equal
than a master, would sit down in my presence, give me his advice
unasked, and enter into conversation with me at all times and
occasions.&nbsp; Did I check him?&nbsp; Certainly not!&nbsp; For
in that case he would have left me, and a more faithful creature
I never knew.&nbsp; His fate was a mournful one, as will appear
in the sequel.</p>
<p>I have said that the Basques abhor servitude, and are rarely
to be found serving as domestics amongst the Spaniards.&nbsp; I
allude, however, merely to the males.&nbsp; The females, on the
contrary, have no objection whatever to enter houses as
servants.&nbsp; Women, indeed, amongst the Basques are not looked
upon with all the esteem which they deserve, and are considered
as fitted for little else than to perform menial offices, even as
in the East, where they are viewed in the light of servants and
slaves.&nbsp; The Basque females differ widely in character from
the men; they are quick and vivacious, and have in general much
more talent.&nbsp; They are famous for their skill as cooks, and
in most respectable houses of Madrid a Biscayan female may be
found in the kitchen, queen supreme of the culinary department.

121</span>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Prohibition&mdash;Gospel
Persecuted&mdash;Charge of Sorcery&mdash;Ofalia.</p>
<p>About the middle of January <a name="citation121a"></a><a
href="#footnote121a" class="citation">[121a]</a> a swoop was made
upon me by my enemies, in the shape of a peremptory prohibition
from the political governor of Madrid to sell any more New
Testaments.&nbsp; This measure by no means took me by surprise,
as I had for some time previously been expecting something of the
kind, on account of the political sentiments of the ministers
then in power.&nbsp; I forthwith paid a visit to Sir George
Villiers, informing him of what had occurred.&nbsp; He promised
to do all he could to cause the prohibition to be
withdrawn.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at this time he had not much
influence, having opposed with all his might the entrance of the
<i>moderado</i> <a name="citation121b"></a><a
href="#footnote121b" class="citation">[121b]</a> ministry to
power, and the nomination of Ofalia <a name="citation121c"></a><a
href="#footnote121c" class="citation">[121c]</a> to the
presidency of the cabinet.&nbsp; I however, never lost confidence
in the Almighty, in whose cause I was engaged.</p>
<p>Matters were going on very well before this check.&nbsp; The
demand for Testaments was becoming considerable, so much so that
the clergy were alarmed, and <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>this step was the consequence.&nbsp;
But they had previously recourse to another, well worthy of them;
they attempted to act upon my fears.&nbsp; One of the ruffians of
Madrid, called <i>Manolos</i>, came up to me one night, in a dark
street, and told me that unless I discontinued selling my
&ldquo;Jewish books,&rdquo; I should have a knife
&ldquo;<i>nailed in my heart</i>;&rdquo; but I told him to go
home, say his prayers, and tell his employers that I pitied them;
whereupon he turned away with an oath.&nbsp; A few days after, I
received an order to send two copies of the Testament to the
office of the political governor, with which I complied, and in
less than twenty-four hours an <i>alguazil</i> arrived at the
shop with a notice prohibiting the further sale of the work.</p>
<p>One circumstance rejoiced me.&nbsp; Singular as it may appear,
the authorities took no measures to cause my little
<i>despacho</i> to be closed, and I received no prohibition
respecting the sale of any work but the New Testament, and as the
Gospel of Saint Luke, in Romany and Basque, would within a short
time be ready for delivery, I hoped to carry on matters in a
small way till better times should arrive.</p>
<p>I was advised to erase from the shop windows the words
&ldquo;<i>Despacho</i> of the British and Foreign Bible
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, however, I refused to do.&nbsp; Those
words had tended very much to call attention, which was my grand
object.&nbsp; Had I attempted to conduct things in an underhand
manner, I should, at the time of which I am speaking, scarcely
have sold thirty copies in Madrid, instead of nearly three
hundred.&nbsp; People who know me not, may be disposed to call me
rash; but I am far from being so, as I never adopt a venturous
course when any other is open to me.&nbsp; I <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>am not,
however, a person to be terrified by any danger, when I see that
braving it is the only way to achieve an object.</p>
<p>The booksellers were unwilling to sell my work; I was
compelled to establish a shop of my own.&nbsp; Every shop in
Madrid has a name.&nbsp; What name could I give it but the true
one?&nbsp; I was not ashamed of my cause or my colours.&nbsp; I
hoisted them, and fought beneath them, not without success.</p>
<p>The priestly party in Madrid, in the mean time, spared no
effort to vilify me.&nbsp; They started a publication called
<i>The Friend of the Christian Religion</i>, in which a stupid
but furious attack upon me appeared, which I, however, treated
with the contempt it deserved.&nbsp; But not satisfied with this,
they endeavoured to incite the populace against me, by telling
them that I was a sorcerer, and a companion of gypsies and
witches, and their agents even called me so in the streets.&nbsp;
That I was an associate of gypsies and fortune-tellers I do not
deny.&nbsp; Why should I be ashamed of their company when my
Master mingled with publicans and thieves?&nbsp; Many of the
gypsy race came frequently to visit me; received instruction, and
heard parts of the Gospel read to them in their own language, and
when they were hungry and faint, I gave them to eat and
drink.&nbsp; This might be deemed sorcery in Spain, but I am not
without hope that it will be otherwise estimated in England; and
had I perished at this period, I think there are some who would
have been disposed to acknowledge that I had not lived altogether
in vain (always as an instrument of the &ldquo;Most
Highest&rdquo;), having been permitted to turn one of the most
valuable books of God into the speech of the most degraded of His
creatures.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>In
the mean time I endeavoured to enter into negotiations with the
ministry for the purpose of obtaining permission to sell the New
Testament in Madrid, and the nullification of the
prohibition.&nbsp; I experienced, however, great opposition,
which I was unable to surmount.&nbsp; Several of the ultra-popish
bishops, then resident in Madrid, had denounced the Bible, the
Bible Society, and myself.&nbsp; Nevertheless, notwithstanding
their powerful and united efforts, they were unable to effect
their principal object, namely, my expulsion from Madrid and
Spain.&nbsp; The Count Ofalia, notwithstanding he had permitted
himself to be made the instrument, to a certain extent, of these
people, would not consent to be pushed to such a length.&nbsp;
Throughout this affair I cannot find words sufficiently strong to
do justice to the zeal and interest which Sir George Villiers
displayed in the cause of the Testament.&nbsp; He had various
interviews with Ofalia on the subject, and in these he expressed
to him his sense of the injustice and tyranny which had been
practised in this instance towards his countryman.</p>
<p>Ofalia had been moved by these remonstrances, and more than
once promised to do all in his power to oblige Sir George; but
then the bishops again beset him, and playing upon his political
if not religious fears, prevented him from acting a just, honest,
and honourable part.&nbsp; At the desire of Sir George Villiers,
I drew up a brief account of the Bible Society, and an exposition
of its views, especially in respect to Spain, which he presented
with his own hand to the Count.&nbsp; I shall not trouble the
reader by inserting this memorial, but content myself with
observing, that I made no attempts to flatter and cajole, but
expressed myself honestly and frankly, as a Christian
ought.&nbsp; <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Ofalia, on reading it, said, &ldquo;What a pity that
this is a Protestant society, and that all its members are not
Catholics!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days subsequently, to my great astonishment, he sent a
message to me by a friend, requesting that I would send him a
copy of my gypsy Gospel.&nbsp; I may as well here state, that the
fame of this work, though not yet published, had already spread
like wildfire through Madrid, and every person was passionately
eager to possess a copy: indeed, several grandees of Spain sent
messages with similar requests, all of which I however
denied.&nbsp; I instantly resolved to take advantage of this
overture on the part of Count Ofalia, and to call on him
myself.&nbsp; I therefore caused a copy of the Gospel to be
handsomely bound, and proceeding to the palace, was instantly
admitted to him.&nbsp; He was a dusky, diminutive person, between
fifty and sixty years of age, with false hair and teeth, but
exceedingly gentlemanly manners.&nbsp; He received me with great
affability, and thanked me for my present; but on my proceeding
to speak of the New Testament, he told me that the subject was
surrounded with difficulties, and that the great body of the
clergy had taken up the matter against me; he conjured me,
however, to be patient and peaceable, in which case he said he
would endeavour to devise some plan to satisfy me.&nbsp; Amongst
other things, he observed that the bishops hated a sectarian more
than an atheist.&nbsp; Whereupon I replied, that, like the
Pharisees of old, they cared more for the gold of the temple than
the temple itself.&nbsp; Throughout the whole of our interview he
evidently laboured under great fear, and was continually looking
behind and around him, seemingly in dread of being overheard,
which brought to my mind <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>an expression of a friend of mine,
that if there be any truth in metempsychosis, the soul of Count
Ofalia must have originally belonged to a mouse.&nbsp; We parted
in kindness, and I went away, wondering by what strange chance
this poor man had become prime minister of a country like
Spain.</p>
<h2><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Two Gospels&mdash;The Alguazil&mdash;The
Warrant&mdash;The Good Maria&mdash;The Arrest&mdash;Sent to
Prison&mdash;Reflections&mdash;The Reception&mdash;The Prison
Room&mdash;Redress demanded.</p>
<p>At length the Gospel of Saint Luke in the gypsy language was
in a state of readiness.&nbsp; I therefore deposited a certain
number of copies in the <i>despacho</i>, and announced them for
sale.&nbsp; The Basque, which was by this time also printed, was
likewise advertised.&nbsp; For this last work there was little
demand.&nbsp; Not so, however, for the gypsy Luke, of which I
could easily have disposed of the whole edition in less than a
fortnight.&nbsp; Long, however, before this period had expired
the clergy were up in arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorcery!&rdquo; said one
bishop.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is more in this than we can dive
into,&rdquo; exclaimed a second.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will convert all
Spain by means of the gypsy language,&rdquo; cried a third.&nbsp;
And then came the usual chorus on such occasions, of <i>Que
infamia</i>!&nbsp; <i>Que picardia</i>!&nbsp; At last, having
consulted together, away they hurried to their tool the
<i>corregidor</i> or, according to the modern term, the <i>gefe
politico</i> <a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a> of Madrid.&nbsp; I have forgotten the
name of this worthy, <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>of whom I had myself no personal
knowledge whatever.&nbsp; Judging from his actions, however, and
from common report, I should say that he was a stupid,
wrong-headed creature, savage withal&mdash;a
<i>m&eacute;lange</i> of <i>borrico</i>, mule, and wolf.&nbsp;
Having an inveterate antipathy to all foreigners, he lent a
willing ear to the complaint of my accusers, and forthwith gave
orders to make a seizure of all the copies of the gypsy Gospel
which could be found in the <i>despacho</i>.&nbsp; The
consequence was, that a numerous body of <i>alguazils</i>
directed their steps to the Calle del Principe; some thirty
copies of the book in question were pounced upon, and about the
same number of Saint Luke in Basque.&nbsp; With this spoil these
satellites returned in triumph to the <i>gefatura politica</i>,
where they divided the copies of the gypsy volume amongst
themselves, selling subsequently the greater number at a large
price, the book being in the greatest demand, and thus becoming
unintentionally agents of an heretical society.&nbsp; But every
one must live by his trade, say these people, and they lose no
opportunity of making their words good, by disposing to the best
advantage of any booty which falls into their hands.&nbsp; As no
person cared about the Basque Gospel, it was safely stowed away,
with other unmarketable captures, in the warehouses of the
office.</p>
<p>The gypsy Gospels had now been seized, at least as many as
were exposed for sale in the <i>despacho</i>.&nbsp; The
<i>corregidor</i> and his friends, however, were of opinion that
many more might be obtained by means of a little
management.&nbsp; Fellows, therefore, hangers on of the
police-office, were daily despatched to the shop in all kinds of
disguises, inquiring, with great seeming anxiety, for
&ldquo;gypsy books,&rdquo; and offering high prices for
copies.&nbsp; They, however, returned to their employers <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>empty-handed.&nbsp; My Gallegan was on his guard,
informing all who made inquiries, that books of no description
would be sold at the establishment for the present.&nbsp; Which
was in truth the case, as I had given him particular orders to
sell no more under any pretence whatever.</p>
<p>I got no credit, however, for my frank dealing.&nbsp; The
<i>corregidor</i> and his confederates could not persuade
themselves but that, by some means mysterious and unknown to
them, I was daily selling hundreds of these gypsy books, which
were to revolutionize the country, and annihilate the power of
the Father of Rome.&nbsp; A plan was therefore resolved upon, by
means of which they hoped to have an opportunity of placing me in
a position which would incapacitate me for some time from taking
any active measures to circulate the Scriptures, either in gypsy
or in any other language.</p>
<p>It was on the morning of the first of May, <a
name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a"
class="citation">[129a]</a> [1838,] if I forget not, that an
unknown individual made his appearance in my apartment as I was
seated at breakfast; he was a mean-looking fellow, about the
middle stature, with a countenance on which knave was written in
legible characters.&nbsp; The hostess ushered him in, and then
withdrew.&nbsp; I did not like the appearance of my visitor, but
assuming some degree of courtesy, I requested him to sit down,
and demanded his business.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come from his
excellency the political <a name="citation129b"></a><a
href="#footnote129b" class="citation">[129b]</a> chief of
Madrid,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and my business is to inform
you that his excellency is perfectly aware of your proceedings,
and is at any time able to prove that you are still disposing of
in secret those evil books which you have been forbidden to
sell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>he so?&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;pray
let him do so forthwith; but what need of giving me
information?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; continued the
fellow, &ldquo;you think his worship has no witnesses; know,
however, that he has many, and respectable ones too.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and from the
respectability of your own appearance, you are perhaps one of
them.&nbsp; But you are occupying my time unprofitably; begone,
therefore, and tell whoever sent you, that I have by no means a
high opinion of his wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall go when I
please,&rdquo; retorted the fellow; &ldquo;do you know to whom
you are speaking?&nbsp; Are you aware that if I think fit I can
search your apartment, yes, even below your bed?&nbsp; What have
we here,&rdquo; he continued, and commenced with his stick poking
a heap of papers which lay upon a chair; &ldquo;what have we
here?&nbsp; Are these also papers of the gypsies?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
instantly determined upon submitting no longer to this behaviour,
and taking the fellow by the arm, led him out of the apartment;
and then, still holding him, conducted him downstairs from the
third floor in which I lived, into the street, looking him
steadfastly in the face the whole while.</p>
<p>The fellow had left his <i>sombrero</i> on the table, which I
despatched to him by the landlady, who delivered it into his hand
as he stood in the street staring with distended eyes at the
balcony of my apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>trampa</i> has been laid for you, <i>Don
Jorge</i>,&rdquo; said Maria Diaz, when she had re-ascended from
the street; &ldquo;that <i>corchete</i> came here with no other
intention than to have a dispute with you.&nbsp; Out of every
word you have said he will make a long history, as is the custom
with these people; indeed, he said, as I handed him his hat, that
ere twenty-four hours were over, you should see the inside of the
prison of Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>In
effect, during the course of the morning, I was told that a
warrant had been issued for my apprehension.&nbsp; The prospect
of incarceration, however, did not fill me with much dismay; an
adventurous life and inveterate habits of wandering having long
familiarized me to situations of every kind, so much so as to
feel myself quite as comfortable in a prison as in the gilded
chambers of palaces; indeed, more so, as in the former place I
can always add to my store of useful information, whereas in the
latter, ennui frequently assails me.&nbsp; I had, moreover, been
thinking for some time past of paying a visit to the prison,
partly in the hope of being able to say a few words of Christian
instruction to the criminals, and partly with the view of making
certain investigations in the robber language of Spain, a subject
about which I had long felt much curiosity; indeed, I had already
made application for admittance into the Carcel de la Corte, <a
name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a> but had found the matter surrounded
with difficulties, as my friend Ofalia would have said.&nbsp; I
rather rejoiced, then, in the opportunity which was now about to
present itself of entering the prison, not in the character of a
visitor for an hour, but as a martyr, and as one suffering in the
holy cause of religion.&nbsp; I was determined, however, to
disappoint my enemies for that day at least, and to render null
the threat of the <i>alguazil</i>, that I should be imprisoned
within twenty-four hours.&nbsp; I therefore took up my abode for
the rest of the day in a celebrated French tavern in the Calle
del Caballero de Gracia, which, as it was one of the most
fashionable and public places in Madrid, I naturally concluded
was one of the last where the <i>corregidor</i> would think of
seeking me.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>About
ten at night, Maria Diaz, to whom I had communicated the place of
my retreat, arrived with her son, Juan Lopez.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>O</i>, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; said she, on seeing
me, &ldquo;they are already in quest of you; the <i>alcalde</i>
of the <i>barrio</i>, with a large <i>comitiva</i> of
<i>alguazils</i> and such-like people, have just been at our
house with a warrant for your imprisonment from the
<i>corregidor</i>.&nbsp; They searched the whole house, and were
much disappointed at not finding you.&nbsp; Woe is me, what will
they do when they catch you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be under no
apprehensions, good Maria,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you forget that
I am an Englishman, and so it seems does the
<i>corregidor</i>.&nbsp; Whenever he catches me, depend upon it
he will be glad enough to let me go.&nbsp; For the present,
however, we will permit him to follow his own course, for the
spirit of folly seems to have seized him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I slept at the tavern, and in the forenoon of the following
day repaired to the Embassy, where I had an interview with Sir
George, to whom I related every circumstance of the affair.&nbsp;
He said that he could scarcely believe that the <i>corregidor</i>
entertained any serious intentions of imprisoning me; in the
first place, because I had committed no offence; and in the
second, because I was not under the jurisdiction of that
functionary, but under that of the captain-general, who was alone
empowered to decide upon matters which relate to foreigners, and
before whom I must be brought in the presence of the consul of my
nation.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no
knowing to what length these jacks in office may go.&nbsp; I
therefore advise you, if you are under any apprehension, to
remain as my guest at the Embassy for a few days, for here you
will be quite safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; I assured him that I was under
no apprehension whatever, having long been <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>accustomed
to adventures of this kind.&nbsp; From the apartment of Sir
George I proceeded to that of the first secretary of embassy, Mr.
Southern, with whom I entered into conversation.&nbsp; I had
scarcely been there a minute when my servant Francisco rushed in,
much out of breath, and in violent agitation, exclaiming in
Basque, &ldquo;<i>Niri jauna</i>, the <i>alguaziloac</i>, and the
<i>corchetoac</i>, and all the other <i>lapurrac</i> <a
name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a> are again at the house.&nbsp; They
seem half mad, and not being able to find you, are searching your
papers, thinking, I suppose, that you are hid among
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Southern here interrupting him, inquired
of me what all this meant.&nbsp; Whereupon I told him, saying at
the same time, that it was my intention to proceed at once to my
lodgings.&nbsp; &ldquo;But perhaps these fellows will arrest
you,&rdquo; said Mr. S., &ldquo;before we can
interfere.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I must take my chance as to
that,&rdquo; I replied, and presently afterwards departed.</p>
<p>Ere, however, I had reached the middle of the street of
Alcal&aacute;, two fellows came up to me, and telling me that I
was their prisoner, commanded me to follow them to the office of
the <i>corregidor</i>.&nbsp; They were, in fact,
<i>alguazils</i>, who, suspecting that I might enter or come out
of the Embassy, had stationed themselves in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I instantly turned round to Francisco, and
told him in Basque to return to the Embassy, and to relate there
to the secretary what had just occurred.&nbsp; The poor fellow
set off like lightning, turning half round, however, to shake his
fist, and to vent a Basque execration at the two <i>lapurrac</i>,
as he called the <i>alguazils</i>.</p>
<p>They conducted me to the <i>gefatura</i>, or office of the <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span><i>corregidor</i>, where they ushered me into a large
room, and motioned me to sit down on a wooden bench.&nbsp; They
then stationed themselves on each side of me.&nbsp; There were at
least twenty people in the apartment beside ourselves, evidently
from their appearance officials of the establishment.&nbsp; They
were all well dressed, for the most part in the French fashion,
in round hats, coats, and pantaloons, and yet they looked what in
reality they were, Spanish <i>alguazils</i>, spies, and
informers: and Gil Blas, could he have waked from his sleep of
two centuries, would, notwithstanding the change of fashion, have
had no difficulty in recognizing them.&nbsp; They glanced at me
as they stood lounging about the room; then gathered themselves
together in a circle and began conversing in whispers.&nbsp; I
heard one of them say, &ldquo;He understands the seven gypsy
jargons.&rdquo; <a name="citation134a"></a><a
href="#footnote134a" class="citation">[134a]</a>&nbsp; Then
presently another, evidently from his language an Andalusian,
said, &ldquo;<i>Es muy diestro</i>, <a name="citation134b"></a><a
href="#footnote134b" class="citation">[134b]</a> and can ride a
horse and dart a knife full as well as if he came from my own
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon they all turned round and
regarded me with a species of interest, evidently mingled with
respect, which most assuredly they would not have exhibited had
they conceived that I was merely an honest man bearing witness in
a righteous cause.</p>
<p>I waited patiently on the bench at least one hour, expecting
every moment to be summoned before my lord the
<i>corregidor</i>.&nbsp; I suppose, however, that I was not
deemed worthy of being permitted to see so exalted a personage,
for at the end of that time, an elderly man&mdash;one, however,
of the <i>alguazil</i> genus&mdash;came into the room and
advanced directly towards me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; I obeyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>name?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; I told him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he replied, exhibiting a paper which he held
in his hand, &ldquo;<i>se&ntilde;or</i>, it is the will of his
excellency the <i>corregidor</i>, that you be forthwith sent to
prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me steadfastly as he spoke, perhaps expecting
that I should sink into the earth at the formidable name of
prison; I, however, only smiled.&nbsp; He then delivered the
paper, which I suppose was the warrant for my committal, into the
hand of one of my two captors, and obeying a sign which they
made, I followed them.</p>
<p>I subsequently learned that the secretary of legation, Mr.
Southern, had been despatched by Sir George, as soon as the
latter had obtained information of my arrest, and had been
waiting at the office during the greater part of the time that I
was there.&nbsp; He had demanded an audience of the
<i>corregidor</i>, in which he had intended to have remonstrated
with him, and pointed out to him the danger to which he was
subjecting himself by the rash step which he was taking.&nbsp;
The sullen functionary, however, had refused to see him,
thinking, perhaps, that to listen to reason would be a
dereliction of dignity; by this conduct, however, he most
effectually served me, as no person, after such a specimen of
uncalled-for insolence, felt disposed to question the violence
and injustice which had been practised towards me.</p>
<p>The <i>alguazils</i> conducted me across the Plaza Mayor to
the Carcel de la Corte, or prison of the court, as it is
called.&nbsp; Whilst going across the square, I remembered that
this was the place where, in &ldquo;the good old times,&rdquo;
the Inquisition of Spain was in the habit of holding its solemn
<i>Autos da f&eacute;</i>, and I cast my eye to the balcony of
the city hall, where at the most solemn <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>of them
all, the last of the Austrian line in Spain sat, and after some
thirty heretics, of both sexes, had been burnt by fours and by
fives, wiped his face, perspiring with heat, and black with
smoke, and calmly inquired, &ldquo;<i>No hay mas</i>?&rdquo; <a
name="citation136"></a><a href="#footnote136"
class="citation">[136]</a> for which exemplary proof of patience
he was much applauded by his priests and confessors, who
subsequently poisoned him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And here am I,&rdquo;
thought I, &ldquo;who have done more to wound Popery than all the
poor Christian martyrs that ever suffered in this accursed
square, merely sent to prison, from which I am sure to be
liberated in a few days, with credit and applause.&nbsp; Pope of
Rome!&nbsp; I believe you to be as malicious as ever, but you are
sadly deficient in power.&nbsp; You are become paralytic,
<i>Batuschca</i>, and your club has degenerated to a
crutch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We arrived at the prison, which stands in a narrow street not
far from the great square.&nbsp; We entered a dusky passage, at
the end of which was a wicket door.&nbsp; My conductors knocked,
a fierce visage peered through the wicket; there was an exchange
of words, and in a few moments I found myself within the prison
of Madrid, in a kind of corridor which overlooked at a
considerable altitude what appeared to be a court, from which
arose a hubbub of voices, and occasionally wild shouts and
cries.&nbsp; Within the corridor, which served as a kind of
office, were several people; one of them sat behind a desk, and
to him the <i>alguazils</i> went up, and after discoursing with
him some time in low tones, delivered the warrant into his
hands.&nbsp; He perused it with attention, then rising he
advanced to me.&nbsp; What a figure!&nbsp; He was about forty
years of age, and his height might have amounted to some six feet
two inches, had he not been curved much after the fashion <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of the
letter S.&nbsp; No weazel ever appeared lanker, and he looked as
if a breath of air would have been sufficient to blow him
away.&nbsp; His face might certainly have been called handsome,
had it not been for its extraordinary and portentous meagreness;
his nose was like an eagle&rsquo;s bill, his teeth white as
ivory, his eyes black&mdash;oh, how black!&mdash;and fraught with
a strange expression; his skin was dark, and the hair of his head
like the plumage of the raven.&nbsp; A deep quiet smile dwelt
continually on his features; but with all the quiet it was a
cruel smile, such a one as would have graced the countenance of a
Nero.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mais en revanche personne
n&rsquo;&eacute;toit plus honn&ecirc;te</i>&rdquo;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Caballero</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;allow me to
introduce myself to you as the <i>alcayde</i> of this
prison.&nbsp; I perceive by this paper that I am to have the
honour of your company for a time, a short time doubtless,
beneath this roof; I hope you will banish every apprehension from
your mind.&nbsp; I am charged to treat you with all the respect
which is due to the illustrious nation to which you belong, and
which a cavalier of such exalted category as yourself is entitled
to expect.&nbsp; A needless charge, it is true, as I should only
have been too happy of my own accord to have afforded you every
comfort and attention.&nbsp; <i>Caballero</i>, you will rather
consider yourself here as a guest than a prisoner; you will be
permitted to roam over every part of this house whenever you
think proper.&nbsp; You will find matters here not altogether
below the attention of a philosophic mind.&nbsp; Pray issue
whatever commands you may think fit to the turnkeys and
officials, even as if they were your own servants, I will now
have the honour of conducting you to your apartment&mdash;the
only one at present unoccupied.&nbsp; We invariably reserve it
for cavaliers of distinction.&nbsp; I am <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>happy to
say that my orders are again in consonance with my
inclination.&nbsp; No charge whatever will be made for it to you,
though the daily hire of it is not unfrequently an ounce of
gold.&nbsp; I entreat you, therefore, to follow me, cavalier, who
am at all times and seasons the most obedient and devoted of your
servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he took off his hat and bowed
profoundly.</p>
<p>Such was the speech of the <i>alcayde</i> of the prison of
Madrid; a speech delivered in pure sonorous Castilian, with
calmness, gravity, and almost with dignity; a speech which would
have done honour to a gentleman of high birth, to Monsieur
Bassompierre, of the Old Bastile, receiving an Italian prince, or
the High Constable of the Tower an English duke attainted of high
treason.&nbsp; Now, who in the name of wonder was this
<i>alcayde</i>?</p>
<p>One of the greatest rascals in all Spain.&nbsp; A fellow who
had more than once, by his grasping cupidity, and by his
curtailment of the miserable rations of the prisoners, caused an
insurrection in the court below, only to be repressed by
bloodshed, and by summoning military aid; a fellow of low birth,
who, only five years previous, had been <i>drummer</i> to a band
of royalist volunteers!</p>
<p>But Spain is the land of extraordinary characters.</p>
<p>I followed the <i>alcayde</i> to the end of the corridor,
where was a massive grated door, on each side of which sat a grim
fellow of a turnkey.&nbsp; The door was opened, and turning to
the right we proceeded down another corridor, in which were many
people walking about, whom I subsequently discovered to be
prisoners like myself, but for political offences.&nbsp; At the
end of this corridor, which extended the whole length of the
<i>patio</i>, we turned into another, and the first apartment <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>in this was
the one destined for myself.&nbsp; It was large and lofty, but
totally destitute of every species of furniture with the
exception of a huge wooden pitcher, intended to hold my daily
allowance of water.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Caballero</i>,&rdquo; said
the <i>alcayde</i>, &ldquo;the apartment is without furniture, as
you see.&nbsp; It is already the third hour of the <i>tarde</i>,
I therefore advise you to lose no time in sending to your
lodgings for a bed and whatever you may stand in need of; the
<i>llavero</i> shall do your bidding.&nbsp; <i>Caballero</i>,
adieu, till I see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed his advice, and, writing a note in pencil to Maria
Diaz, I despatched it by the <i>llavero</i>, and then, sitting
down on the wooden pitcher, I fell into a reverie, which
continued for a considerable time.</p>
<p>Night arrived, and so did Maria Diaz, attended by two porters
and Francisco, all loaded with furniture.&nbsp; A lamp was
lighted, charcoal was kindled in the <i>brasero</i>, and the
prison gloom was to a certain degree dispelled.</p>
<p>I now left my seat on the pitcher, and sitting down on a
chair, proceeded to despatch some wine and viands, which my good
hostess had not forgotten to bring with her.&nbsp; Suddenly Mr.
Southern entered.&nbsp; He laughed heartily at finding me engaged
in the manner I have described.&nbsp; &ldquo;B---,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;you are the man to get through the world, for you
appear to take all things coolly, and as matters of course.&nbsp;
That, however, which most surprises me with respect to you is,
your having so many friends; here you are in prison, surrounded
by people ministering to your comforts.&nbsp; Your very servant
is your friend, instead of being your worst enemy, as is usually
the case.&nbsp; That Basque of yours is a noble fellow.&nbsp; I
shall never forget how he spoke for you, when he came running <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>to the
Embassy to inform us of your arrest.&nbsp; He interested both Sir
George and myself in the highest degree: should you ever wish to
part with him, I hope you will give me the refusal of his
services.&nbsp; But now to other matters.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
informed me that Sir George had already sent in an official note
to Ofalia, demanding redress for such a wanton outrage on the
person of a British subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must remain in
prison,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to-night, but depend upon it that
to-morrow, if you are disposed, you may quit in
triumph.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am by no means disposed for any
such thing,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have put me in
prison for their pleasure, and I intend to remain here for my
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If the confinement is not irksome to
you,&rdquo; said Mr. Southern, &ldquo;I think, indeed, it will be
your wisest plan; the government have committed themselves sadly
with regard to you; and, to speak plainly, we are by no means
sorry for it.&nbsp; They have on more than one occasion treated
ourselves very cavalierly, and we have now, if you continue firm,
an excellent opportunity of humbling their insolence.&nbsp; I
will instantly acquaint Sir George with your determination, and
you shall hear from us early on the morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
bade me farewell; and flinging myself on my bed, I was soon
asleep in the prison of Madrid.</p>

Corte&mdash;Sunday in Prison&mdash;Robber Dress&mdash;Father and
Son&mdash;Characteristic Behaviour&mdash;The
Frenchman&mdash;Prison Allowance&mdash;Valley of the
Shadow&mdash;Pure Castilian&mdash;Balseiro&mdash;The
Cave&mdash;Robber Glory.</p>
<p>Ofalia quickly perceived that the imprisonment of a British
subject in a manner so illegal as that which had attended my own
was likely to be followed by rather serious consequences.&nbsp;
Whether he himself had at all encouraged the <i>corregidor</i> in
his behaviour towards me, it is impossible to say; the
probability is that he had not: the latter, however, was an
officer of his own appointing, for whose actions himself and the
government were to a certain extent responsible.&nbsp; Sir George
had already made a very strong remonstrance upon the subject, and
had even gone so far as to state in an official note that he
should desist from all farther communication with the Spanish
government until full and ample reparation had been afforded me
for the violence to which I had been subjected.&nbsp;
Ofalia&rsquo;s reply was, that immediate measures should be taken
for my liberation, and that it would be my own fault if I
remained in prison.&nbsp; He forthwith ordered a <i>juez de la
primera instancia</i>, <a name="citation141"></a><a
href="#footnote141" class="citation">[141]</a> a kind of
solicitor-general, to wait <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>upon me, who was instructed to hear
my account of the affair, and then to dismiss me with an
admonition to be cautious for the future.&nbsp; My friends of the
Embassy, however, had advised me how to act in such a case.&nbsp;
Accordingly, when the <i>juez</i> on the second night of my
imprisonment made his appearance at the prison, and summoned me
before him, I went, but on his proceeding to question me, I
absolutely refused to answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I deny your right to
put any questions to me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I entertain,
however, no feelings of disrespect to the government or to
yourself, <i>Caballero Juez</i>; but I have been illegally
imprisoned.&nbsp; So accomplished a jurist as yourself cannot
fail to be aware that, according to the laws of Spain, I, as a
foreigner, could not be committed to prison for the offence with
which I had been charged, without previously being conducted
before the captain-general of this royal city, whose duty it is
to protect foreigners, and see that the laws of hospitality are
not violated in their persons.</p>
<p><i>Juez</i>.&mdash;Come, come, <i>Don Jorge</i>, I see what
you are aiming at; but listen to reason: I will not now speak to
you as a <i>juez</i>, but as a friend who wishes you well, and
who entertains a profound reverence for the British nation.&nbsp;
This is a foolish affair altogether; I will not deny that the
political chief acted somewhat hastily on the information of a
person not perhaps altogether worthy of credit.&nbsp; No great
damage, however, has been done to you, and to a man of the world
like yourself, a little adventure of this kind is rather
calculated to afford amusement than anything else.&nbsp; Now be
advised, forget what has happened; you know that it is the part
and duty of a Christian to forgive.&nbsp; So, <i>Don Jorge</i>, I
advise you to leave this place forthwith; I dare say you are
getting tired of it.&nbsp; You are this <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>moment free
to depart; repair at once to your lodgings, where I promise you
that no one shall be permitted to interrupt you for the
future.&nbsp; It is getting late, and the prison doors will
speedily be closed for the night.&nbsp; <i>Vamos</i>, <i>Don
Jorge</i>, <i>&aacute; la casa</i>, <i>&aacute; la posada</i>! <a
name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a"
class="citation">[143a]</a></p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;But Paul said unto them, they have
beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into
prison; and now do they thrust us out privily?&nbsp; Nay, verily:
but let them come themselves and fetch us out.&rdquo; <a
name="citation143b"></a><a href="#footnote143b"
class="citation">[143b]</a></p>
<p>I then bowed to the <i>juez</i>, who shrugged his shoulders
and took snuff.&nbsp; On leaving the apartment I turned to the
<i>alcayde</i>, who stood at the door: &ldquo;Take notice,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;that I will not quit this prison till I have
received full satisfaction for being sent hither
uncondemned.&nbsp; You may expel me if you please, but any
attempt to do so shall be resisted with all the bodily strength
of which I am possessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship is right,&rdquo; said the <i>alcayde</i>,
with a bow, but in a low voice.</p>
<p>Sir George, on hearing of this affair, sent me a letter in
which he highly commended my resolution not to leave the prison
for the present, at the same time begging me to let him know if
there were anything that he could send me from the Embassy to
render my situation more tolerable.</p>
<p>I will now leave for the present my own immediate affairs, and
proceed to give some account of the prison of Madrid and its
inmates.</p>
<p>The Carcel de la Corte, where I now was, though the principal
prison of Madrid, is one which certainly in no respect does
credit to the capital of Spain.&nbsp; <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>Whether it was originally intended
for the purpose to which it is at present applied, I have no
opportunity of knowing.&nbsp; The chances, however, are, that it
was not; indeed it was not till of late years that the practice
of building edifices expressly intended and suited for the
incarceration of culprits came at all into vogue.&nbsp; Castles,
convents, and deserted palaces, have in all countries, at
different times, been converted into prisons, which practice
still holds good upon the greater part of the continent, and more
particularly in Spain and Italy, which accounts to a certain
extent for the insecurity of the prisons, and the misery, want of
cleanliness, and unhealthiness which in general pervade them.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to enter into a particular description of
the prison of Madrid; indeed it would be quite impossible to
describe so irregular and rambling an edifice.&nbsp; Its
principal features consisted of two courts, the one behind the
other: intended for the great body of the prisoners to take air
and recreation in.&nbsp; Three large vaulted dungeons, or
<i>calabozos</i>, occupied three sides of this court, immediately
below the corridors of which I have already spoken.&nbsp; These
dungeons were roomy enough to contain respectively from one
hundred to one hundred and fifty prisoners, who were at night
secured therein with lock and bar, but during the day were
permitted to roam about the courts as they thought fit.&nbsp; The
second court was considerably larger than the first, though it
contained but two dungeons, horribly filthy and disgusting
places; this second court being used for the reception of the
lower grades of thieves.&nbsp; Of the two dungeons one was, if
possible, yet more horrible than the other; it was called the
<i>gallineria</i>, or chicken-coop, and within it every night <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>were pent
up the young fry of the prison, wretched boys from seven to
fifteen years of age, the greater part almost in a state of
nudity.&nbsp; The common bed of all the inmates of these dungeons
was the ground, between which and their bodies nothing
intervened, save occasionally a <i>manta</i> or horse-cloth, or
perhaps a small mattress; this latter luxury was, however, of
exceedingly rare occurrence.</p>
<p>Besides the <i>calabozos</i> connected with the courts were
other dungeons in various parts of the prison; some of them quite
dark, intended for the reception of those whom it might be deemed
expedient to treat with peculiar severity.&nbsp; There was
likewise a ward set apart for females.&nbsp; Connected with the
principal corridor were many small apartments, where resided
prisoners confined for debt or for political offences.&nbsp; And,
lastly, there was a small <i>capilla</i>, or chapel, in which
prisoners cast for death passed the last three days of their
existence in company of their ghostly advisers.</p>
<p>I shall not soon forget my first Sunday in prison, Sunday is
the gala day of the prison, at least of that of Madrid, and
whatever robber finery is to be found within it is sure to be
exhibited on that day of holiness.&nbsp; There is not a set of
people in the world more vain than robbers in general, more fond
of cutting a figure whenever they have an opportunity, and of
attracting the eyes of their fellow-creatures by the gallantry of
their appearance.&nbsp; The famous Sheppard of olden times
delighted in sporting a suit of Genoese velvet, and when he
appeared in public generally wore a silver-hilted sword at his
side; whilst Vaux and Hayward, heroes of a later day, were the
best dressed men on the <i>pav&eacute;</i> of London.&nbsp; Many
of the Italian bandits go splendidly decorated, and the very <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>gypsy
robber has a feeling for the charms of dress; the cap alone of
the Haram Pasha, or leader of the cannibal gypsy band which
infested Hungary towards the conclusion of the last century, was
adorned with gold and jewels to the value of four thousand
guilders.&nbsp; Observe, ye vain and frivolous, how vanity and
crime harmonize!&nbsp; The Spanish robbers are as fond of this
species of display as their brethren of other lands, and, whether
in prison or out of it, are never so happy as when, decked out in
a profusion of white linen, they can loll in the sun, or walk
jauntily up and down.</p>
<p>Snow-white linen, indeed, constitutes the principal feature in
the robber foppery of Spain.&nbsp; Neither coat nor jacket is
worn over the shirt, the sleeves of which are wide and flowing,
only a waistcoat of green or blue silk with an abundance of
silver buttons, which are intended more for show than use, as the
vest is seldom buttoned.&nbsp; Then there are wide trousers,
something after the Turkish fashion; around the waist is a
crimson <i>faja</i>, or girdle, and about the head is tied a
gaudily coloured handkerchief from the loom of Barcelona; light
pumps and silk stockings complete the robber&rsquo;s array.&nbsp;
This dress is picturesque enough, and well adapted to the fine
sunshiny weather of the Peninsula; there is a dash of effeminacy
about it, however, hardly in keeping with the robber&rsquo;s
desperate trade.&nbsp; It must not, however, be supposed that it
is every robber who can indulge in all this luxury; there are
various grades of thieves, some poor enough, with scarcely a rag
to cover them.&nbsp; Perhaps in the crowded prison of Madrid
there were not more than twenty who exhibited the dress which I
have attempted to describe above; these were <i>jente de
reputacion</i>, <a name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146"
class="citation">[146]</a> tip-top thieves, mostly <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>young
fellows, who, though they had no money of their own, were
supported in prison by their <i>majas</i> and <i>amigas</i>, <a
name="citation147a"></a><a href="#footnote147a"
class="citation">[147a]</a> females of a certain class, who form
friendships with robbers, and whose glory and delight it is to
administer to the vanity of these fellows with the wages of their
own shame and abasement.&nbsp; These females supplied their
<i>cortejos</i> with the snowy linen, washed, perhaps, by their
own hands in the waters of the Manzanares, for the display of the
Sunday, when they would themselves make their appearance, dressed
<i>&agrave; la maja</i>, and from the corridors would gaze with
admiring eyes upon the robbers vapouring about in the court
below.</p>
<p>Amongst those of the snowy linen who most particularly
attracted my attention, were a father and son; the former was a
tall athletic figure of about thirty, by profession a
housebreaker, and celebrated throughout Madrid for the peculiar
dexterity which he exhibited in his calling.&nbsp; He was now in
prison for a rather atrocious murder committed in the dead of
night, in a house at Caramanchel, <a name="citation147b"></a><a
href="#footnote147b" class="citation">[147b]</a> in which his
only accomplice was his son, a child under seven years of
age.&nbsp; &ldquo;The apple,&rdquo; as the Danes say, &ldquo;had
not fallen far from the tree;&rdquo; the imp was in every respect
the counterpart of the father, though in miniature.&nbsp; He,
too, wore the robber shirt-sleeves, the robber waistcoat with the
silver buttons, the robber kerchief round his brow, and,
ridiculous enough, a long Manchegan knife in the crimson
<i>faja</i>.&nbsp; He was evidently the pride of the <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>ruffian
father, who took all imaginable care of this chick of the
gallows, would dandle him on his knee, and would occasionally
take the cigar from his own moustached lips and insert it in the
urchin&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; The boy was the pet of the court, for
the father was one of the <i>valientes</i> of the prison, and
those who feared his prowess, and wished to pay their court to
him, were always fondling the child.&nbsp; What an enigma is this
world of ours!&nbsp; How dark and mysterious are the sources of
what is called crime and virtue!&nbsp; If that infant wretch
become eventually a murderer like his father, is he to
blame?&nbsp; Fondled by robbers, already dressed as a robber,
born of a robber, whose own history was perhaps similar.&nbsp; Is
it right? . . .</p>
<p>Oh, man, man, seek not to dive into the mystery of moral good
and evil; confess thyself a worm, cast thyself on the earth, and
murmur with thy lips in the dust, Jesus, Jesus!</p>
<p>What most surprised me with respect to the prisoners was their
good behaviour; I call it good when all things are taken into
consideration, and when I compare it with that of the general
class of prisoners in foreign lands.&nbsp; They had their
occasional bursts of wild gaiety, their occasional quarrels,
which they were in the habit of settling in a corner of the
interior court with their long knives; <a
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a> the result not unfrequently being
death, or a dreadful gash in the face or the abdomen; but, upon
the whole, their conduct was infinitely superior to what might
have been expected from the inmates of such a place.&nbsp; Yet
this was not the result of coercion, or any particular care which
was exercised over them; for perhaps in no part of the world are
prisoners so left to themselves and so <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>utterly
neglected as in Spain: the authorities having no farther anxiety
about them than to prevent their escape; not the slightest
attention being paid to their moral conduct, and not a thought
bestowed upon their health, comfort, or mental improvement,
whilst within the walls.&nbsp; Yet in this prison of Madrid, and
I may say in Spanish prisons in general, for I have been an
inmate of more than one, <a name="citation149"></a><a
href="#footnote149" class="citation">[149]</a> the ears of the
visitor are never shocked with horrid blasphemy and obscenity, as
in those of some other countries, and more particularly in
civilized France; nor are his eyes outraged and himself insulted,
as he would assuredly be, were he to look down upon the courts
from the galleries of the Bic&ecirc;tre.&nbsp; And yet in this
prison of Madrid were some of the most desperate characters in
Spain; ruffians who had committed acts of cruelty and atrocity
sufficient to make the flesh shudder.&nbsp; But gravity and
sedateness are the leading characteristics of the Spaniards, and
the very robber, except in those moments when he is engaged in
his occupation, and then no one is more sanguinary, pitiless, and
wolfishly eager for booty, is a being who can be courteous and
affable, and who takes pleasure in conducting himself with
sobriety and decorum.</p>
<p>Happily, perhaps, for me, that my acquaintance with the
ruffians of Spain commenced and ended in the towns about which I
wandered, and in the prisons into which I was cast for the
Gospel&rsquo;s sake, and that, notwithstanding my long and
frequent journeys, I never came in contact with them on the road
or in the <i>despoblado</i>.</p>
<p>The most ill-conditioned being in the prison was a Frenchman,
though probably the most remarkable.&nbsp; <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>He was
about sixty years of age, of the middle stature, but thin and
meagre, like most of his countrymen; he had a villanously formed
head, according to all the rules of craniology, and his features
were full of evil expression.&nbsp; He wore no hat, and his
clothes, though in appearance nearly new, were of the coarsest
description.&nbsp; He generally kept aloof from the rest, and
would stand for hours together leaning against the walls with his
arms folded, glaring sullenly on what was passing before
him.&nbsp; He was not one of the professed <i>valientes</i>, for
his age prevented his assuming so distinguished a character, and
yet all the rest appeared to hold him in a certain awe: perhaps
they feared his tongue, which he occasionally exerted in pouring
forth withering curses upon those who incurred his
displeasure.&nbsp; He spoke perfectly good Spanish, and to my
great surprise excellent Basque, in which he was in the habit of
conversing with Francisco, who, lolling from the window of my
apartment, would exchange jests and witticisms with the prisoners
in the court below, with whom he was a great favourite.</p>
<p>One day when I was in the <i>patio</i>, to which I had free
admission whenever I pleased, by permission of the
<i>alcayde</i>, I went up to the Frenchman, who stood in his
usual posture, leaning against the wall, and offered him a
cigar.&nbsp; I do not smoke myself, but it will never do to mix
among the lower classes of Spain unless you have a cigar to
present occasionally.&nbsp; The man glared at me ferociously for
a moment, and appeared to be on the point of refusing my offer
with perhaps a hideous execration.&nbsp; I repeated it, however,
pressing my hand against my heart, whereupon suddenly the grim
features relaxed, and with a genuine French grimace, and a low
bow, he accepted the cigar, <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Ah</i>,
<i>monsieur</i>, <i>pardon</i>, <i>mais c&rsquo;est faire trop
d&rsquo;honneur &agrave; un pauvre diable comme
moi</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are both
fellow-prisoners in a foreign land, and being so we ought to
countenance each other.&nbsp; I hope that whenever I have need of
your co-operation in this prison you will afford it
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah</i>, <i>monsieur</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed the
Frenchman in rapture, &ldquo;<i>vous avez bien raison</i>; <i>il
faut que les &eacute;trangers se donnent la main dans ce . . .
pays de barbares</i>.&nbsp; <i>Tenez</i>,&rdquo; he added in a
whisper, &ldquo;if you have any plan for escaping, and require my
assistance, I have an arm and a knife at your service: you may
trust me, and that is more than you could any of these
<i>sacr&eacute;es gens ici</i>,&rdquo; glancing fiercely round at
his fellow-prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appear to be no friend to Spain and the
Spaniards,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I conclude that you have
experienced injustice at their hands.&nbsp; For what have they
immured you in this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pour rien du tout</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est &agrave; dire
pour une bagatelle</i>; but what can you expect from such
animals?&nbsp; For what are you imprisoned?&nbsp; Did I not hear
say for gypsyism and sorcery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are here for your opinions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah</i>, <i>mon Dieu</i>, <i>non</i>; <i>je ne suis
pas homme &agrave; semblable betise</i>.&nbsp; I have no
opinions.&nbsp; <i>Je faisois . . . mais ce n&rsquo;importe</i>;
<i>je me trouve ici</i>, <i>o&ugrave; je cr&egrave;ve de
faim</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to see a brave man in such a distressed
condition,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have you nothing to subsist upon
beyond the prison allowance?&nbsp; Have you no
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends in this country?&nbsp; You mock me; here one
has no friends, unless one buy them.&nbsp; I am bursting with
hunger.&nbsp; Since I have been here I have sold the <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>clothes off
my back, that I might eat, for the prison allowance will not
support nature, and of half of that we are robbed by the
<i>Batu</i>, as they called the barbarian of a governor.&nbsp;
<i>Les haillons</i> which now cover me were given by two or three
devotees who sometimes visit here.&nbsp; I would sell them if
they would fetch aught.&nbsp; I have not a <i>sou</i>, and for
want of a few crowns I shall be garroted within a month unless I
can escape, though, as I told you before, I have done nothing, a
mere bagatelle; but the worst crimes in Spain are poverty and
misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard you speak Basque; are you from French
Biscay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am from Bordeaux, <i>monsieur</i>; but I have lived
much on the Landes and in Biscay, <i>travaillant &agrave; mon
m&eacute;tier</i>.&nbsp; I see by your look that you wish to know
my history.&nbsp; I shall not tell it you.&nbsp; It contains
nothing that is remarkable.&nbsp; See, I have smoked out your
cigar; you may give me another, and add a dollar if you please,
<i>nous sommes crev&eacute;s ici de faim</i>.&nbsp; I would not
say as much to a Spaniard, but I have a respect for your
countrymen; I know much of them; I have met them at Maida and the
other place.&rdquo; <a name="citation152"></a><a
href="#footnote152" class="citation">[152]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing remarkable in his history!&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, or
I greatly err, one chapter of his life, had it been written,
would have unfolded more of the wild and wonderful than fifty
volumes of what are in general called adventures and hairbreadth
escapes by land and sea.&nbsp; A soldier! what a tale could that
man have told of marches and retreats, of battles lost and won,
towns sacked, convents plundered! perhaps he had seen the flames
of Moscow ascending to the clouds, and had &ldquo;tried his
strength with nature in the wintry desert,&rdquo; <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>pelted by
the snowstorm, and bitten by the tremendous cold of Russia.&nbsp;
And what could he mean by plying his trade in Biscay and Landes,
but that he had been a robber in those wild regions, of which the
latter is more infamous for brigandage and crime than any other
part of the French territory?&nbsp; Nothing remarkable in his
history! then what history in the world contains aught that is
remarkable?</p>
<p>I gave him the cigar and dollar.&nbsp; He received them, and
then once more folding his arms, leaned back against the wall,
and appeared to sink gradually into one of his reveries.&nbsp; I
looked him in the face and spoke to him, but he did not seem
either to hear or see me.&nbsp; His mind was perhaps wandering in
that dreadful valley of the shadow, into which the children of
earth, whilst living, occasionally find their way: that dreadful
region where there is no water, where hope dwelleth not, where
nothing lives but the undying worm.&nbsp; This valley is the
facsimile of hell, and he who has entered it has experienced here
on earth for a time what the spirits of the condemned are doomed
to suffer through ages without end.</p>
<p>He was executed about a month from this time.&nbsp; The
bagatelle for which he was confined was robbery and murder by the
following strange device.&nbsp; In concert with two others, he
hired a large house in an unfrequented part of the town, to which
place he would order tradesmen to convey valuable articles, which
were to be paid for on delivery; those who attended paid for
their credulity with the loss of their lives and property.&nbsp;
Two or three had fallen into the snare.&nbsp; I wished much to
have had some private conversation with this desperate man, and
in consequence begged of the <i>alcayde</i> to allow him to dine
with me in my <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>own apartment; whereupon Monsieur Bassompierre, for so
I will take the liberty of calling the governor, his real name
having escaped my memory, took off his hat, and, with his usual
smile and bow, replied in purest Castilian, &ldquo;English
cavalier, and I hope I may add friend, pardon me, that it is
quite out of my power to gratify your request, founded, I have no
doubt, on the most admirable sentiments of philosophy.&nbsp; Any
of the other gentlemen beneath my care shall, at any time you
desire it, be permitted to wait upon you in your apartment.&nbsp;
I will even go so far as to cause their irons, if irons they
wear, to be knocked off in order that they may partake of your
refection with that comfort which is seemly and convenient: but
to the gentleman in question I must object; he is the most evil
disposed of the whole of this family, and would most assuredly
breed a <i>funcion</i> either in your apartment or in the
corridor, by an attempt to escape.&nbsp; Cavalier, <i>me
pesa</i>, <a name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154"
class="citation">[154]</a> but I cannot accede to your
request.&nbsp; But with respect to any other gentleman, I shall
be most happy, even Balseiro, who, though strange things are told
of him, still knows how to comport himself, and in whose
behaviour there is something both of formality and politeness,
shall this day share your hospitality if you desire it,
cavalier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of Balseiro I have already had occasion to speak in the former
part of this narrative.&nbsp; He was now confined in an upper
story of the prison, in a strong room, with several other
malefactors.&nbsp; He had been found guilty of aiding and
assisting one Pepe Candelas, a thief of no inconsiderable renown,
in a desperate robbery perpetrated in open daylight upon no less
a personage than the queen&rsquo;s milliner, a Frenchwoman, <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>whom they
bound in her own shop, from which they took goods and money to
the amount of five or six thousand dollars.&nbsp; Candelas had
already expiated his crime on the scaffold, but Balseiro, who was
said to be by far the worst ruffian of the two, had by dint of
money, an ally which his comrade did not possess, contrived to
save his own life; the punishment of death, to which he was
originally sentenced, having been commuted to twenty years&rsquo;
hard labour in the <i>presidio</i> of Malaga.&nbsp; I visited
this worthy, and conversed with him for some time through the
wicket of the dungeon.&nbsp; He recognized me, and reminded me of
the victory which I had once obtained over him, in the trial of
our respective skill in the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>, at which
Sevilla the bull-fighter was umpire.</p>
<p>Upon my telling him that I was sorry to see him in such a
situation, he replied that it was an affair of no manner of
consequence, as within six weeks he should be conducted to the
<i>presidio</i>, from which, with the assistance of a few ounces
distributed amongst the guards, he could at any time
escape.&nbsp; &ldquo;But whither would you flee?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I not flee to the land of the
Moors,&rdquo; replied Balseiro, &ldquo;or to the English in the
camp of Gibraltar; or, if I prefer it, cannot I return to this
<i>foro</i>, and live as I have hitherto done, <i>choring</i> the
<i>gachos</i>; <a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a> what is to hinder me?&nbsp; Madrid is
large, and Balseiro has plenty of friends, especially among the
<i>lumias</i>,&rdquo; he added, with a smile.&nbsp; I spoke to
him of his ill-fated accomplice Candelas; whereupon his face
assumed a horrible expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope he is in
torment,&rdquo; exclaimed the robber.&nbsp; The friendship of the
unrighteous is never of long duration; the two worthies had, it
seems, <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>quarrelled in prison; Candelas having accused the other
of bad faith and an undue appropriation to his own use of the
<i>corpus delicti</i> in various robberies which they had
committed in company.</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from relating the subsequent history of this
Balseiro.&nbsp; Shortly after my own liberation, too impatient to
wait until the <i>presidio</i> should afford him a chance of
regaining his liberty, he, in company with some other convicts,
broke through the roof of the prison and escaped.&nbsp; He
instantly resumed his former habits, committing several daring
robberies, both within and without the walls of Madrid.&nbsp; I
now come to his last, I may call it his master crime, a singular
piece of atrocious villany.&nbsp; Dissatisfied with the proceeds
of street robbery and house-breaking, he determined upon a bold
stroke, by which he hoped to acquire money sufficient to support
him in some foreign land in luxury and splendour.</p>
<p>There was a certain comptroller of the queen&rsquo;s
household, by name Gabiria, <a name="citation156"></a><a
href="#footnote156" class="citation">[156]</a> a Basque by birth,
and a man of immense possessions: this individual had two sons,
handsome boys, between twelve and fourteen years of age, whom I
had frequently seen, and indeed conversed with, in my walks on
the bank of the Manzanares, which was their favourite
promenade.&nbsp; These children, at the time of which I am
speaking, were receiving their education at a certain seminary in
Madrid.&nbsp; Balseiro, being well acquainted with the
father&rsquo;s affection for his children, determined to make it
subservient to his own rapacity.&nbsp; He formed a plan, which
was neither more nor less than to steal the children, and not to
restore them to their parent until he had received an enormous
ransom.&nbsp; This plan was <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>partly carried into execution: two
associates of Balseiro, well dressed, drove up to the door of the
seminary where the children were, and, by means of a forged
letter, purporting to be written by the father, induced the
schoolmaster to permit the boys to accompany them for a country
jaunt, as they pretended.&nbsp; About five leagues from Madrid
Balseiro had a cave, in a wild unfrequented spot between the
Escurial and a village called Torre Lodones: to this cave the
children were conducted, where they remained in durance under the
custody of the two accomplices; Balseiro in the mean time
remaining in Madrid for the purpose of conducting negociations
with the father.&nbsp; The father, however, was a man of
considerable energy, and instead of acceding to the terms of the
ruffian, communicated in a letter, instantly took the most
vigorous measures for the recovery of his children.&nbsp; Horse
and foot were sent out to scour the country, and in less than a
week the children were found near the cave, having been abandoned
by their keepers, who had taken fright on hearing of the decided
measures which had been resorted to; they were, however, speedily
arrested and identified by the boys as their ravishers.&nbsp;
Balseiro, perceiving that Madrid was becoming too hot to hold
him, attempted to escape, but whether to the camp of Gibraltar or
to the land of the Moor, I know not; he was recognized, however,
at a village in the neighbourhood of Madrid, and being
apprehended, was forthwith conducted to the capital, where he
shortly after terminated his existence on the scaffold, with his
two associates; Gabiria and his children being present at the
ghastly scene, which they surveyed from a chariot at their
ease.</p>
<p>Such was the end of Balseiro, of whom I should <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>certainly
not have said so much, but for the affair of the crabbed
<i>Gitano</i>.&nbsp; Poor wretch! he acquired that species of
immortality which is the object of the aspirations of many a
Spanish thief, whilst vapouring about in the <i>patio</i>,
dressed in the snowy linen; the rape of the children of Gabiria
made him at once the pet of the fraternity.&nbsp; A celebrated
robber, with whom I was subsequently imprisoned at Seville, spoke
his eulogy in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Balseiro was a very good subject, and an honest
man.&nbsp; He was the head of our family, <i>Don Jorge</i>; we
shall never see his like again; pity that he did not sack the
<i>parn&eacute;</i>, and escape to the camp of the Moor, <i>Don
Jorge</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Maria Diaz&mdash;Priestly
Vituperation&mdash;Antonio&rsquo;s Visit&mdash;Antonio at
Service&mdash;A Scene&mdash;Benedict Mol&mdash;Wandering in
Spain&mdash;The Four Evangelien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I to Maria Diaz, on the third morning
after my imprisonment, &ldquo;what do the people of Madrid say to
this affair of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what the people of Madrid in general say
about it, probably they do not take much interest in it; indeed,
imprisonments at the present time are such common matters, that
people seem to be quite indifferent to them; the priests,
however, are in no slight commotion, and confess that they have
committed an imprudent thing in causing you to be arrested by
their friend the <i>corregidor</i> of Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are they
afraid that their friend will be punished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Not so, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; replied
Maria; &ldquo;slight grief indeed would it cause them, however
great the trouble in which he had involved himself on their
account; for this description of people have no affection, and
would not care if all their friends were hanged, provided they
themselves escaped.&nbsp; But they say that they have acted
imprudently in sending you to prison, inasmuch as by so doing
they have given you an <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>opportunity of carrying a plan of
yours into execution.&nbsp; &lsquo;This fellow is a
<i>bribon</i>,&rsquo; say they, &lsquo;and has commenced
tampering with the prisoners; they have taught him their
language, which he already speaks as well as if he were a son of
the prison.&nbsp; As soon as he comes out he will publish a
thieves&rsquo; Gospel, which will be a still more dangerous
affair than the gypsy one, for the gypsies are few, but the
thieves! woe is us; we shall all be Lutheranized.&nbsp; What
infamy, what rascality!&nbsp; It was a trick of his own.&nbsp; He
was always eager to get into prison, and now, in evil hour, we
have sent him there, <i>el bribonazo</i>; there will be no safety
for Spain until he is hanged; he ought to be sent to the four
hells, where at his leisure he might translate his fatal gospels
into the language of the demons.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I but said three words to the <i>alcayde</i> of the
prison,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;relative to the jargon used by the
children of the prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three words!&nbsp; <i>Don Jorge</i>; and what may not
be made out of three words?&nbsp; You have lived amongst us to
little purpose if you think we require more than three words to
build a system with.&nbsp; Those three words about the thieves
and their tongue were quite sufficient to cause it to be reported
throughout Madrid that you had tampered with the thieves, had
learnt their language, and had written a book which was to
overturn Spain, open to the English the gates of Cadiz, give
Mendizabal all the church plate and jewels, and to Don Martin
Luther the archiepiscopal palace of Toledo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of rather a gloomy day, as I was sitting
in the apartment which the <i>alcayde</i> had allotted me, I
heard a rap at the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>that?&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est
moi</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; cried a well-known
voice, and presently in walked Antonio Buchini, dressed in the
same style as when I first introduced him to the reader, namely,
in a handsome but rather faded French surtout, vest, and
pantaloons, with a diminutive hat in one hand, and holding in the
other a long and slender cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon jour</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said
the Greek; then, glancing around the apartment, he continued,
&ldquo;I am glad to find you so well lodged.&nbsp; If I remember
right, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, we have slept in worse places
during our wanderings in Galicia and Castile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, Antonio,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;I am very comfortable.&nbsp; Well, this is kind of you to
visit your ancient master, more especially now he is in the
toils; I hope, however, that by so doing you will not offend your
present employer.&nbsp; His dinner hour must be at hand; why are
you not in the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what employer are you speaking, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>?&rdquo; demanded Antonio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of whom should I speak but Count ---, to serve whom you
abandoned me, being tempted by an offer of a monthly salary less
by four dollars than that which I was giving you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship brings an affair to my remembrance which I
had long since forgotten.&nbsp; I have at present no other master
than yourself, <i>Monsieur Georges</i>, for I shall always
consider you as my master, though I may not enjoy the felicity of
waiting upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have left the Count, then,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;after remaining three days in the house, according to your
usual practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not three hours, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo;
replied Antonio; &ldquo;but I will tell you the
circumstances.&nbsp; Soon after <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>I left you I repaired to the house
of <i>Monsieur le Comte</i>; I entered the kitchen, and looked
about me.&nbsp; I cannot say that I had much reason to be
dissatisfied with what I saw: the kitchen was large and
commodious, and everything appeared neat and in its proper place,
and the domestics civil and courteous; yet, I know not how it
was, the idea at once rushed into my mind that the house was by
no means suited to me, and that I was not destined to stay there
long; so, hanging my haversack upon a nail, and sitting down on
the dresser, I commenced singing a Greek song, as I am in the
habit of doing when dissatisfied.&nbsp; The domestics came about
me, asking questions.&nbsp; I made them no answer, however, and
continued singing till the hour for preparing the dinner drew
nigh, when I suddenly sprang on the floor, and was not long in
thrusting them all out of the kitchen, telling them that they had
no business there at such a season.&nbsp; I then at once entered
upon my functions.&nbsp; I exerted myself, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>&mdash;I exerted myself, and was preparing a
repast which would have done me honour; there was, indeed, some
company expected that day, and I therefore determined to show my
employer that nothing was beyond the capacity of his Greek
cook.&nbsp; <i>Eh bien</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, all was
going on remarkably well, and I felt almost reconciled to my new
situation, when who should rush into the kitchen but <i>le fils
de la maison</i>, my young master, an ugly urchin of thirteen
years or thereabouts.&nbsp; He bore in his hand a manchet of
bread, which, after prying about for a moment, he proceeded to
dip in the pan where some delicate woodcocks were in the course
of preparation.&nbsp; You know, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, how
sensitive I am on certain points, for I am no Spaniard, but a
Greek, and have <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>principles of honour.&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation I took my young master by the shoulders, and hurrying
him to the door, dismissed him in the manner which he
deserved.&nbsp; Squalling loudly, he hurried away to the upper
part of the house.&nbsp; I continued my labours, but ere three
minutes had elapsed, I heard a dreadful confusion above stairs,
<i>on faisoit une horrible tintamarre</i>, and I could
occasionally distinguish oaths and execrations.&nbsp; Presently
doors were flung open, and there was an awful rushing downstairs,
a gallopade.&nbsp; It was my lord the count, his lady, and my
young master, followed by a regular bevy of women and <i>filles
de chambre</i>.&nbsp; Far in advance of all, however, was my lord
with a drawn sword in his hand, shouting, &lsquo;Where is the
wretch who has dishonoured my son, where is he?&nbsp; He shall
die forthwith.&rsquo;&nbsp; I know not how it was, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>, but I just then chanced to spill a large bowl
of <i>garbanzos</i>, which were intended for the <i>puchera</i>
of the following day.&nbsp; They were uncooked, and were as hard
as marbles; these I dashed upon the floor, and the greater part
of them fell just about the doorway.&nbsp; <i>Eh bien</i>, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>, in another moment in bounded the count, his
eyes sparkling like coals, and, as I have already said, with a
rapier in his hand. &lsquo;<i>Tenez</i>, <i>gueux
enrag&eacute;</i>,&rsquo; he screamed, making a desperate lunge
at me; but ere the words were out of his mouth, his foot slipping
on the pease, he fell forward with great violence at his full
length, and his weapon flew out of his hand, <i>comme une
fl&ecirc;che</i>.&nbsp; You should have heard the outcry which
ensued&mdash;there was a terrible confusion: the count lay upon
the floor to all appearance stunned.&nbsp; I took no notice,
however, continuing busily employed.&nbsp; They at last raised
him up, and assisted him till he <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>came to himself, though very pale
and much shaken.&nbsp; He asked for his sword: all eyes were now
turned upon me, and I saw that a general attack was
meditated.&nbsp; Suddenly I took a large <i>casserole</i> from
the fire in which various eggs were frying; this I held out at
arm&rsquo;s length, peering at it along my arm as if I were
curiously inspecting it, my right foot advanced and the other
thrown back as far as possible.&nbsp; All stood still, imagining,
doubtless, that I was about to perform some grand operation, and
so I was: for suddenly the sinister leg advancing, with one rapid
<i>coup de pied</i>, I sent the <i>casserole</i> and its contents
flying over my head, so that they struck the wall far behind
me.&nbsp; This was to let them know that I had broken my staff
and had shaken the dust off my feet; so casting upon the count
the peculiar glance of the Sceirote cooks when they feel
themselves insulted, and extending my mouth on either side nearly
as far as the ears, I took down my haversack and departed,
singing as I went the song of the ancient Demos, who, when dying,
asked for his supper, and water wherewith to lave his
hands&mdash;</p>

<p>And in this manner, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, I left the house
of the Count of ---.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And a fine account you have given of
yourself; by your own confession, your behaviour was most
atrocious.&nbsp; Were it not for the many marks of courage and
fidelity which you have exhibited in my service, I would from
this moment hold no further communication with you.</p>

full of honour and sensibility?&nbsp; Would you have the cooks of
Sceira and Stambul submit to be insulted here in Spain by the
sons of counts rushing into the temple with manchets of
bread?&nbsp; <i>Non</i>, <i>non</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, you
are too noble to require that, and what is more, <i>too
just</i>.&nbsp; But we will talk of other things.&nbsp; <i>Mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>, I came not alone, there is one now waiting in
the corridor anxious to speak to you.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Who is it?</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;One whom you have met, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>, in various and strange places.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;But who is it?</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;One who will come to a strange end,
<i>for so it is written</i>.&nbsp; The most extraordinary of all
the Swiss, he of Saint James&mdash;<i>Der Schatz Gr&auml;ber</i>.
<a name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a></p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Not Benedict Mol?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yaw</i>, <i>mein lieber Herr</i>,&rdquo; said
Benedict, pushing open the door which stood ajar; &ldquo;it is
myself.&nbsp; I met <i>Herr Anton</i> in the street, and hearing
that you were in this place, I came with him to visit
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And in the name of all that is singular,
how is it that I see you in Madrid again?&nbsp; I thought that by
this time you were returned to your own country.</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Fear not, <i>lieber Herr</i>, I shall
return thither in good time; but not on foot, but with mules and
coach.&nbsp; The <i>Schatz</i> is still yonder, waiting to be dug
up, and now I have better hope than ever; plenty of friends,
plenty of money.&nbsp; See you not how I am dressed, <i>lieber
Herr</i>?</p>
<p>And verily his habiliments were of a much more <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>respectable
appearance than any which he had sported on former
occasions.&nbsp; His coat and pantaloons, which were of light
green, were nearly new.&nbsp; On his head he still wore an
Andalusian hat, but the present one was neither old nor shabby,
but fresh and glossy, and of immense altitude of cone; whilst in
his hand, instead of the ragged staff which I had observed at
Saint James and Oviedo, he now carried a huge bamboo rattan,
surmounted by the grim head of either a bear or lion, curiously
cut out of pewter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all the appearance of a treasure-seeker
returned from a successful expedition,&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or rather,&rdquo; interrupted Antonio, &ldquo;of one
who has ceased to trade on his own bottom, and now goes seeking
treasures at the cost and expense of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I questioned the Swiss minutely concerning his adventures
since I last saw him, when I left him at Oviedo to pursue my
route to Santander.&nbsp; From his answers I gathered that he had
followed me to the latter place; he was, however, a long time in
performing the journey, being weak from hunger and
privation.&nbsp; At Santander he could hear no tidings of me, and
by this time the trifle which he had received from me was
completely exhausted.&nbsp; He now thought of making his way into
France, but was afraid to venture through the disturbed
provinces, lest he should fall into the hands of the Carlists,
who he conceived might shoot him as a spy.&nbsp; No one relieving
him at Santander, he departed and begged his way till he found
himself in some part of Aragon, but where he scarcely knew.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My misery was so great,&rdquo; said Benedict, &ldquo;that
I nearly lost my senses.&nbsp; Oh, the horror of wandering about
the savage hills and wide plains of Spain, without money and
without hope!&nbsp; Sometimes I became <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>desperate,
when I found myself amongst rocks and <i>barrancos</i>, perhaps
after having tasted no food from sunrise to sunset; and then I
would raise my staff towards the sky and shake it, crying,
<i>Lieber Herr Gott</i>, <i>ach lieber Herr Gott</i>, you must
help me now or never; if you tarry I am lost; you must help me
now, now!&nbsp; And once, when I was raving in this manner,
methought I heard a voice&mdash;nay, I am sure I heard
it&mdash;sounding from the hollow of a rock, clear and strong;
and it cried, &lsquo;<i>Der Schatz</i>, <i>der Schatz</i>, it is
not yet dug up; to Madrid, to Madrid.&nbsp; The way to the
<i>Schatz</i> is through Madrid.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the
thought of the <i>Schatz</i> once more rushed into my mind, and I
reflected how happy I might be, could I but dig up the
<i>Schatz</i>.&nbsp; No more begging then; no more wandering
amidst horrid mountains and deserts; so I brandished my staff,
and my body and my limbs became full of new and surprising
strength, and I strode forward, and was not long before I reached
the high road; and then I begged and bettled as I best could,
until I reached Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what has befallen you since you reached
Madrid?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you find the treasure
in the streets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a sudden Benedict became reserved and taciturn, which the
more surprised me, as, up to the present moment, he had at all
times been remarkably communicative with respect to his affairs
and prospects.&nbsp; From what I could learn from his broken
hints and innuendos, it appeared that, since his arrival at
Madrid, he had fallen into the hands of certain people who had
treated him with kindness, and provided him both with money and
clothes; not from disinterested motives, however, but having an
eye to the treasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;They <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>expect
great things from me,&rdquo; said the Swiss; &ldquo;and perhaps,
after all, it would have been more profitable to have dug up the
treasure without their assistance, always provided that were
possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who his new friends were he either knew
not or would not tell me, save that they were people in
power.&nbsp; He said something about Queen Christina and an oath
which he had taken in the presence of a bishop on the crucifix
and the four <i>Evangelien</i>.&nbsp; I thought that his head was
turned, and forbore questioning.&nbsp; Just before taking his
departure, he observed, &ldquo;<i>Lieber Herr</i>, pardon me for
not being quite frank towards you, to whom I owe so much, but I
dare not; I am not now my own man.&nbsp; It is, moreover, an evil
thing at all times to say a word about treasure before you have
secured it.&nbsp; There was once a man in my own country who dug
deep into the earth until he arrived at a copper vessel which
contained a <i>Schatz</i>.&nbsp; Seizing it by the handle, he
merely exclaimed in his transport, &lsquo;I have it!&rsquo; that
was enough, however: down sank the kettle, though the handle
remained in his grasp.&nbsp; That was all he ever got for his
trouble and digging.&nbsp; Farewell, <i>lieber Herr</i>, I shall
speedily be sent back to Saint James to dig up the <i>Schatz</i>;
but I will visit you ere I go&mdash;farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remained about three weeks in the prison of Madrid, and then
left it.&nbsp; If I had possessed any pride, or harboured any
rancour against the party who had consigned me to durance, the
manner in which I was restored to liberty would no doubt have
been highly gratifying to those evil passions; the government
having acknowledged, by a document transmitted to Sir George,
that I had been incarcerated on insufficient grounds, and that no
stigma attached itself to me from the imprisonment I had
undergone; at the same time agreeing to defray all the expenses
to which I had been subjected throughout the progress of this
affair.</p>
<p>It moreover expressed its willingness to dismiss the
individual owing to whose information I had been first arrested,
namely, the <i>corchete</i>, or police officer, who had visited
me in my apartments in the Calle de Santiago, and behaved himself
in the manner which I have described in a former chapter.&nbsp; I
declined, however, to avail myself of this condescension of the
government, more especially as I was informed that the <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>individual
in question had a wife and family, who, if he were disgraced,
would be at once reduced to want.&nbsp; I moreover considered
that, in what he had done and said, he had probably only obeyed
some private orders which he had received; I therefore freely
forgave him, and if he does not retain his situation at the
present moment, it is certainly no fault of mine.</p>
<p>I likewise refused to accept any compensation for my expenses,
which were considerable.&nbsp; It is probable that many persons
in my situation would have acted very differently in this
respect, and I am far from saying that herein I acted discreetly
or laudably; but I was averse to receive money from people such
as those of which the Spanish Government was composed, people
whom I confess I heartily despised, and I was unwilling to afford
them an opportunity of saying that after they had imprisoned an
Englishman unjustly, and without a cause, he condescended to
receive money at their hands.&nbsp; In a word, I confess my own
weakness; I was willing that they should continue my debtors, and
have little doubt that they had not the slightest objection to
remain so: they kept their money, and probably laughed in their
sleeves at my want of common sense.</p>
<p>The heaviest loss which resulted from my confinement, and for
which no indemnification could be either offered or received, was
in the death of my affectionate and faithful Basque Francisco,
who, having attended me during the whole time of my imprisonment,
caught the pestilential typhus or gaol fever, which was then
raging in the Carcel de la Corte, of which he expired within a
few days subsequent to my liberation. <a
name="citation170"></a><a href="#footnote170"
class="citation">[170]</a>&nbsp; His death occurred late one
evening.&nbsp; The <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>next morning, as I was lying in bed ruminating on my
loss, and wondering of what nation my next servant would be, I
heard a noise which seemed to be that of a person employed
vigorously in cleaning boots or shoes, and at intervals a strange
discordant voice singing snatches of a song in some unknown
language: wondering who it could be, I rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ring, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>?&rdquo; said
Antonio, appearing at the door with one of his arms deeply buried
in a boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did ring,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I
scarcely expected that you would have answered the
summons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais pourquoi non</i>, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>?&rdquo; cried Antonio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who should
serve you now but myself?&nbsp; <i>N&rsquo;est pas que le sieur
Fran&ccedil;ois est mort</i>?&nbsp; And did I not say, as soon as
I heard of his departure, I shall return to my functions <i>chez
mon ma&icirc;tre</i>, <i>Monsieur Georges</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you had no other employment, and on that
account you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Au contraire</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo;
replied the Greek, &ldquo;I had just engaged myself at the house
of the Duke of Frias, <a name="citation171"></a><a
href="#footnote171" class="citation">[171]</a> from whom I was to
receive ten dollars per month more than I shall accept from your
worship; but on hearing that you were without a domestic, I
forthwith told the duke, though it was late at night, that he
would not suit me; and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not receive you in this manner,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;return to the duke, apologize for your behaviour, request
your dismission in a regular way; and then, if his grace is
willing to part with you, as will most probably be the case, I
shall be happy to avail myself of your services.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>It is
reasonable to expect that after having been subjected to an
imprisonment which my enemies themselves admitted to be unjust, I
should in future experience more liberal treatment at their hands
than that which they had hitherto adopted towards me.&nbsp; The
sole object of my ambition at this time was to procure toleration
for the sale of the Gospel in this unhappy and distracted
kingdom, and to have attained this end I would not only have
consented to twenty such imprisonments in succession as that
which I had undergone, but would gladly have sacrificed life
itself.&nbsp; I soon perceived, however, that I was likely to
gain nothing by my incarceration; on the contrary, I had become
an object of personal dislike to the government since the
termination of this affair, which it was probable I had never
been before; their pride and vanity were humbled by the
concessions which they had been obliged to make in order to avoid
a rupture with England.&nbsp; This dislike they were now
determined to gratify, by thwarting my views as much as
possible.&nbsp; I had an interview with Ofalia on the subject
uppermost in my mind; I found him morose and snappish.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be for your interest to be still,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;beware! you have already thrown the whole <i>corte</i>
into confusion; beware, I repeat; another time you may not escape
so easily.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;and perhaps I do not wish it; it is a pleasant thing to be
persecuted for the Gospel&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; I now take the
liberty of inquiring whether, if I attempt to circulate the Word
of God, I am to be interrupted.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; exclaimed Ofalia; &ldquo;the Church forbids such
circulation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall make the attempt,
however,&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean what you
say?&rdquo; demanded Ofalia, arching his eyebrows and elongating
his mouth.&nbsp; <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I shall make the
attempt in every village in Spain to which I can
penetrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout my residence in Spain the clergy were the party
from which I experienced the strongest opposition; and it was at
their instigation that the government originally adopted those
measures which prevented any extensive circulation of the sacred
volume through the land.&nbsp; I shall not detain the course of
my narrative with reflections as to the state of a Church, which,
though it pretends to be founded on Scripture, would yet keep the
light of Scripture from all mankind, if possible.&nbsp; But Rome
is fully aware that she is not a Christian Church, and having no
desire to become so, she acts prudently in keeping from the eyes
of her followers the page which would reveal to them the truths
of Christianity.&nbsp; Her agents and minions throughout Spain
exerted themselves to the utmost to render my humble labours
abortive, and to vilify the work which I was attempting to
disseminate.&nbsp; All the ignorant and fanatical clergy (the
great majority) were opposed to it, and all those who were
anxious to keep on good terms with the court of Rome were loud in
their cry against it.&nbsp; There was, however, one section of
the clergy, a small one, it is true, rather favourably disposed
towards the circulation of the Gospel, though by no means
inclined to make any particular sacrifice for the accomplishment
of such an end: these were such as professed liberalism, which is
supposed to mean a disposition to adopt any reform, both in civil
and Church matters, which may be deemed conducive to the weal of
the country.&nbsp; Not a few amongst the Spanish clergy were
supporters of this principle, or at least declared themselves so;
some doubtless for their own advancement, hoping to turn <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>the spirit
of the times to their own personal profit: others, it is to be
hoped, from conviction, and a pure love of the principle
itself.&nbsp; Amongst these were to be found, at the time of
which I am speaking, several bishops.&nbsp; It is worthy of
remark, however, that of all these not one but owed his office,
not to the Pope, who disowned them one and all, but to the Queen
Regent, the professed head of liberalism throughout all
Spain.&nbsp; It is not, therefore, surprising that men thus
circumstanced should feel rather disposed than not to countenance
any measure or scheme at all calculated to favour the advancement
of liberalism; and surely such an one was the circulation of the
Scriptures.&nbsp; I derived but little assistance from their good
will, however, supposing that they entertained some, as they
never took any decided stand, nor lifted up their voices in a
bold and positive manner, denouncing the conduct of those who
would withhold the light of Scripture from the world.&nbsp; At
one time I hoped by their instrumentality to accomplish much in
Spain in the Gospel cause; but I was soon undeceived, and became
convinced that reliance on what they would effect was like
placing the hand on a staff of reed, which will only lacerate the
flesh.&nbsp; More than once some of them sent messages to me,
expressive of their esteem, and assuring me how much the cause of
the Gospel was dear to their hearts.&nbsp; I even received an
intimation that a visit from me would be agreeable to the
Archbishop of Toledo, the Primate of Spain.</p>
<p>Of this personage I can say but little, his early history
being entirely unknown to me.&nbsp; At the death of Ferdinand, I
believe, he was Bishop of Mallorca, a small insignificant see, of
very scanty revenues, which perhaps he had no objection to
exchange for one <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>more wealthy.&nbsp; It is probable, however, that had
he proved a devoted servant of the Pope, and consequently a
supporter of legitimacy, he would have continued to the day of
his death to fill the episcopal chair of Mallorca; but he was
said to be a liberal, and the Queen Regent thought fit to bestow
upon him the dignity of Archbishop of Toledo, by which he became
the head of the Spanish Church.&nbsp; The Pope, it is true, had
refused to ratify the nomination, on which account all good
Catholics were still bound to consider him as Bishop of Mallorca,
and not as Primate of Spain.&nbsp; He, however, received the
revenues belonging to the see, which, though only a shadow of
what they originally were, were still considerable, and lived in
the primate&rsquo;s palace at Madrid, so that if he were not
archbishop <i>de jure</i>, he was what many people would have
considered much better, archbishop <i>de facto</i>. <a
name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a></p>
<p>Hearing that this personage was a personal friend of Ofalia,
who was said to entertain a very high regard for him, I
determined upon paying him a visit, and accordingly one morning
betook myself to the palace in which he resided.&nbsp; I
experienced no difficulty in obtaining an interview, being
forthwith conducted to his presence by a common kind of footman,
an Asturian, I believe, whom I found seated on a stone bench in
the entrance-hall.&nbsp; When I was introduced, the archbishop
was alone, seated behind a table in a large apartment, a kind of
drawing-room; he was plainly dressed, in a black cassock and
silken cap; <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>on his finger, however, glittered a superb amethyst,
the lustre of which was truly dazzling.&nbsp; He rose for a
moment as I advanced, and motioned me to a chair with his
hand.&nbsp; He might be about sixty years of age; his figure was
very tall, but he stooped considerably, evidently from
feebleness, and the pallid hue of ill-health overspread his
emaciated features.&nbsp; When he had reseated himself, he
dropped his head, and appeared to be looking on the table before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your lordship knows who I am?&rdquo; said I,
at last breaking silence.</p>
<p>The archbishop bent his head towards the right shoulder, in a
somewhat equivocal manner, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am he whom the <i>Manolos</i> of Madrid call <i>Don
Jorgito el Ingles</i>; I am just come out of prison, whither I
was sent for circulating my Lord&rsquo;s Gospel in this kingdom
of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The archbishop made the same equivocal motion with his head,
but still said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was informed that your lordship was desirous of
seeing me, and on that account I have paid you this
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not send for you,&rdquo; said the archbishop,
suddenly, raising his head with a startled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not: I was, however, given to understand that
my presence would be agreeable; but as that does not seem to be
the case, I will leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you are come, I am very glad to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rdquo; said I, reseating
myself; &ldquo;and since I am here, we may as well talk of an
all-important matter, the circulation of the Scripture.&nbsp;
Does your lordship see any way by which an end so desirable might
be brought about?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the archbishop, faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does not your lordship think that a knowledge of the
Scripture would work inestimable benefit in these
realms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it probable that the government may be induced to
consent to the circulation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; and the archbishop looked me
in the face.</p>
<p>I looked in the face of the archbishop; there was an
expression of helplessness in it, which almost amounted to
dotage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;whom have
I come to on an errand like mine?&nbsp; Poor man! you are not
fitted to play the part of Martin Luther, and least of all in
Spain.&nbsp; I wonder why your friends selected you to be
Archbishop of Toledo; they thought perhaps that you would do
neither good nor harm, and made choice of you, as they sometimes
do primates in my own country, for your incapacity.&nbsp; You do
not seem very happy in your present situation; no very easy stall
this of yours.&nbsp; You were more comfortable, I trow, when you
were the poor Bishop of Mallorca; could enjoy your <i>puchera</i>
then without fear that the salt would turn out sublimate.&nbsp;
No fear then of being smothered in your bed.&nbsp; A
<i>siesta</i> is a pleasant thing when one is not subject to be
disturbed by &lsquo;the sudden fear.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wonder
whether they have poisoned you already,&rdquo; I continued, half
aloud, as I kept my eyes fixed on his countenance, which
methought was becoming ghastly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you speak, <i>Don Jorge</i>?&rdquo; demanded the
archbishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a fine brilliant on your lordship&rsquo;s
hand,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&ldquo;You are fond of brilliants, <i>Don
Jorge</i>,&rdquo; said the archbishop, his features brightening
up; &ldquo;<i>vaya</i>! so am I; they are pretty things.&nbsp; Do
you understand them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I never saw a finer
brilliant than your own, one excepted; it belonged to an
acquaintance of mine, a Tartar Khan.&nbsp; He did not bear it on
his finger, however; it stood in the frontlet of his horse, where
it shone like a star.&nbsp; He called it <i>Daoud Scharr</i>,
which, being interpreted, meaneth <i>light of war</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vaya</i>!&rdquo; said the archbishop, &ldquo;how
very extraordinary!&nbsp; I am glad you are fond of brilliants,
<i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; Speaking of horses, reminds me that I
have frequently seen you on horseback.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>! how you
ride!&nbsp; It is dangerous to be in your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your lordship fond of equestrian
exercise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, <i>Don Jorge</i>; I do not like
horses.&nbsp; It is not the practice of the Church to ride on
horseback.&nbsp; We prefer mules; they are the quieter
animals.&nbsp; I fear horses, they kick so violently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kick of a horse is death,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if
it touches a vital part.&nbsp; I am not, however, of your
lordship&rsquo;s opinion with respect to mules: a good
<i>ginete</i> may retain his seat on a horse however vicious, but
a mule&mdash;<i>vaya</i>! when a false mule <i>tira por
detras</i>, <a name="citation178a"></a><a href="#footnote178a"
class="citation">[178a]</a> I do not believe that the Father of
the Church himself could keep the saddle a moment, however sharp
his bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I was going away, I said, &ldquo;And with respect to the
Gospel, your lordship, what am I to understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No s&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation178b"></a><a href="#footnote178b"
class="citation">[178b]</a> said the archbishop, again bending
his head towards the right shoulder, whilst his features resumed
their former vacant expression.&nbsp; And thus <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>terminated
my interview with the Archbishop of Toledo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; said I to Maria Diaz, on
returning home; &ldquo;it appears to me, <i>Marequita mia</i>,
that if the Gospel in Spain is to wait for toleration until these
liberal bishops and archbishops come forward boldly in its
behalf, it will have to tarry a considerable time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much of your worship&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo;
answered Maria; &ldquo;a fine thing, truly, it would be to wait
till they exerted themselves in its behalf.&nbsp; <i>Ca</i>! <a
name="citation179a"></a><a href="#footnote179a"
class="citation">[179a]</a> the idea makes me smile.&nbsp; Was
your worship ever innocent enough to suppose that they cared one
tittle about the Gospel or its cause?&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>! they are
true priests, and had only self-interest in view in their
advances to you.&nbsp; The Holy Father disowns them, and they
would now fain, by awaking his fears and jealousy, bring him to
some terms; but let him once acknowledge them, and see whether
they would admit you to their palaces or hold any intercourse
with you!&nbsp; &lsquo;Forth with the fellow!&rsquo; they would
say; &lsquo;<i>vaya</i>! is he not a Lutheran?&nbsp; Is he not an
enemy to the Church?&nbsp; <i>&Aacute; la horca</i>, <i>&aacute;
la horca</i>!&rsquo; <a name="citation179b"></a><a
href="#footnote179b" class="citation">[179b]</a>&nbsp; I know
this family better than you do, <i>Don Jorge</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless tarrying,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;nothing,
however, can be done in Madrid.&nbsp; I cannot sell the work at
the <i>despacho</i>, and I have just received intelligence that
all the copies exposed for sale in the libraries in the different
parts of Spain which I have visited have been sequestrated by
order of the government.&nbsp; My resolution is taken: I shall
mount my horses, which are neighing in the stable, and betake
myself to the villages and plains of dusty Spain.&nbsp; <i>Al
campo</i>, <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span><i>al campo</i>: <a name="citation180a"></a><a
href="#footnote180a" class="citation">[180a]</a> &lsquo;Ride
forth, because of the word of righteousness, and thy right hand
shall show thee terrible things. <a name="citation180b"></a><a
href="#footnote180b" class="citation">[180b]</a>&nbsp; I will
ride forth, Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship can do no better; and allow me here to
tell you, that for every single book you might sell in a
<i>despacho</i> in the city, you may dispose of one hundred
amongst the villages, always provided you offer them cheap; for
in the country money is rather scant.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>! should I
not know? am I not a villager myself, a <i>villana</i> from the
Sagra?&nbsp; Ride forth, therefore: your horses are neighing in
the stall, as your worship says, and you might almost have added
that the <i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Antonio is neighing in the
house.&nbsp; He says he has nothing to do, on which account he is
once more dissatisfied and unsettled.&nbsp; He finds fault with
everything, but more particularly with myself.&nbsp; This morning
I saluted him, and he made me no reply, but twisted his mouth in
a manner very uncommon in this land of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thought strikes me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you have
mentioned the Sagra; why should not I commence my labours amongst
the villages of that district?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship can do no better,&rdquo; replied Maria;
&ldquo;the harvest is just over there, and you will find the
people comparatively unemployed, with leisure to attend and
listen to you; and if you follow my advice, you will establish
yourself at Villa Seca, in the house of my fathers, where at
present lives my lord and husband.&nbsp; Go, therefore, to Villa
Seca in the first place, and from thence you can sally forth with
the <i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Antonio upon your excursions.&nbsp;
Peradventure, <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>my husband will accompany you; and if so, you will find
him highly useful.&nbsp; The people of Villa Seca are civil and
courteous, your worship; when they address a foreigner, they
speak to him at the top of their voice and in
Gallegan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Gallegan!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all understand a few words of Gallegan, which they
have acquired from the mountaineers, who occasionally assist them
in cutting the harvest, and as Gallegan is the only foreign
language they know, they deem it but polite to address a
foreigner in that tongue.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>! it is not a bad
village, that of Villa Seca, nor are the people; the only
ill-conditioned person living there is his reverence the
curate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not long in making preparations for my enterprise.&nbsp;
A considerable stock of Testaments were sent forward by an
<i>arriero</i>, I myself followed the next day.&nbsp; Before my
departure, however, I received a visit from Benedict Mol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am come to bid you farewell, <i>lieber Herr</i>;
tomorrow I return to Compostella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what errand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To dig up the <i>Schatz</i>, <i>lieber Herr</i>.&nbsp;
For what else should I go?&nbsp; For what have I lived until now,
but that I may dig up the <i>Schatz</i> in the end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have lived for something better,&rdquo; I
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you success, however.&nbsp; But on
what grounds do you hope?&nbsp; Have you obtained permission to
dig?&nbsp; Surely you remember your former trials in
Galicia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not forgotten them, <i>lieber Herr</i>, nor the
journey to Oviedo, nor &lsquo;the seven acorns,&rsquo; nor the
fight with death in the <i>barranco</i>.&nbsp; But I must
accomplish my destiny.&nbsp; I go now to Galicia, as is becoming
<a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>a Swiss,
at the expense of the government, with coach and mule, I mean in
the <i>galera</i>.&nbsp; I am to have all the help I require, so
that I can dig down to the earth&rsquo;s centre if I think
fit.&nbsp; I&mdash;but I must not tell your worship, for I am
sworn on &lsquo;the four <i>Evangelien</i>,&rsquo; not to
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Benedict, I have nothing to say, save that I hope
you will succeed in your digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, <i>lieber Herr</i>, thank you; and now
farewell.&nbsp; Succeed!&nbsp; I shall succeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
he stopped short, started, and looking upon me with an expression
of countenance almost wild, he exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Heiliger
Gott</i>!&nbsp; I forgot one thing.&nbsp; Suppose I should not
find the treasure after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very rationally said; pity, though, that you did not
think of that contingency till now.&nbsp; I tell you, my friend,
that you have engaged in a most desperate undertaking.&nbsp; It
is true that you may find a treasure.&nbsp; The chances are,
however, a hundred to one that you do not, and in that event what
will be your situation?&nbsp; You will be looked upon as an
impostor, and the consequences may be horrible to you.&nbsp;
Remember where you are, and amongst whom you are.&nbsp; The
Spaniards are a credulous people, but let them once suspect that
they have been imposed upon, and above all laughed at, and their
thirst for vengeance knows no limit.&nbsp; Think not that your
innocence will avail you.&nbsp; That you are no impostor I feel
convinced; but they would never believe it.&nbsp; It is not too
late.&nbsp; Return your fine clothes and magic rattan to those
from whom you had them.&nbsp; Put on your old garments, grasp
your ragged staff, and come with me to the Sagra, to assist in
circulating the illustrious Gospel amongst the rustics on the
Tagus&rsquo; bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>Benedict mused for a moment, then, shaking his head, he
cried, &ldquo;No, no, I must accomplish my destiny.&nbsp; The
<i>Schatz</i> is not yet dug up.&nbsp; So said the voice in the
<i>barranco</i>.&nbsp; To-morrow to Compostella.&nbsp; I shall
find it&mdash;the <i>Schatz</i>&mdash;it is still there&mdash;it
<i>must</i> be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went, and I never saw him more.&nbsp; What I heard,
however, was extraordinary enough.&nbsp; It appeared that the
government had listened to his tale, and had been so struck with
Benedict&rsquo;s exaggerated description of the buried treasure,
that they imagined that, by a little trouble and outlay, gold and
diamonds might be dug up at Saint James sufficient to enrich
themselves and to pay off the national debt of Spain.&nbsp; The
Swiss returned to Compostella &ldquo;like a duke,&rdquo; to use
his own words.&nbsp; The affair, which had at first been kept a
profound secret, was speedily divulged.&nbsp; It was, indeed,
resolved that the investigation, which involved consequences of
so much importance, should take place in a manner the most public
and imposing.&nbsp; A solemn festival was drawing nigh, and it
was deemed expedient that the search should take place upon that
day.&nbsp; The day arrived.&nbsp; All the bells in Compostella
pealed.&nbsp; The whole populace thronged from their houses, a
thousand troops were drawn up in the square, the expectation of
all was wound up to the highest pitch.&nbsp; A procession
directed its course to the church of San Roque; at its head was
the captain-general and the Swiss, brandishing in his hand the
magic rattan; close behind walked the <i>meiga</i>, the Gallegan
witch-wife, by whom the treasure-seeker had been originally
guided in the search; numerous masons brought up the rear,
bearing implements to break up the ground.&nbsp; The procession
enters the church, they pass through it in solemn march, they
find themselves in a vaulted <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>passage.&nbsp; The Swiss looks
around.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dig here,&rdquo; said he suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, dig here,&rdquo; said the <i>meiga</i>.&nbsp; The
masons labour, the floor is broken up,&mdash;a horrible and fetid
odour arises. . . .</p>
<p>Enough; no treasure was found, and my warning to the
unfortunate Swiss turned out but too prophetic.&nbsp; He was
forthwith seized and flung into the horrid prison of Saint James,
amidst the execrations of thousands, who would have gladly torn
him limb from limb.</p>
<p>The affair did not terminate here.&nbsp; The political
opponents of the government did not allow so favourable an
opportunity to escape for launching the shafts of ridicule.&nbsp;
The <i>moderados</i> were taunted in the cortes for their avarice
and credulity, whilst the liberal press wafted on its wings
through Spain the story of the treasure-hunt at Saint James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, it was a <i>trampa</i> of <i>Don
Jorge&rsquo;s</i>,&rdquo; said one of my enemies.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That fellow is at the bottom of half the <i>picardias</i>
which happen in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eager to learn the fate of the Swiss, I wrote to my old friend
Rey Romero, at Compostella.&nbsp; In his answer he states:
&ldquo;I saw the Swiss in prison, to which place he sent for me,
craving my assistance, for the sake of the friendship which I
bore to you.&nbsp; But how could I help him?&nbsp; He was
speedily after removed from Saint James, I know not
whither.&nbsp; It is said that he disappeared on the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.&nbsp; Where in the
whole cycle of romance shall we find anything more wild,
grotesque, and sad, than the easily authenticated history of
Benedict Mol, the treasure-digger of Saint James?</p>

185</span>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Villa Seca&mdash;Moorish House&mdash;The
Puchera&mdash;The Rustic Council&mdash;Polite
Ceremonial&mdash;The Flower of Spain&mdash;The Bridge of
Azeca&mdash;The Ruined Castle&mdash;Taking the Field&mdash;Demand
for the Word&mdash;The Old Peasant&mdash;The Curate and
Blacksmith&mdash;Cheapness of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>It was one of the most fiercely hot days in which I ever
braved the sun, when I arrived at Villa Seca.&nbsp; The heat in
the shade must have amounted at least to one hundred degrees, and
the entire atmosphere seemed to consist of flickering
flame.&nbsp; At a place called Leganez, six leagues from Madrid,
and about half way to Toledo, we diverged from the highway,
bending our course seemingly towards the south-east.&nbsp; We
rode over what are called plains in Spain, but which, in any
other part of the world, would be called undulating and broken
ground.&nbsp; The crops of corn and barley had already
disappeared, the last vestiges discoverable being here and there
a few sheaves, which the labourers were occupied in removing to
their garners in the villages.&nbsp; The country could scarcely
be called beautiful, being perfectly naked, exhibiting neither
trees nor verdure.&nbsp; It was not, however, without its
pretensions to grandeur and magnificence, like every part of
Spain.&nbsp; The most prominent objects were two <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>huge
calcareous hills, or rather one cleft in twain, which towered up
on high; the summit of the nearest being surmounted by the ruins
of an ancient castle, that of Villaluenga.&nbsp; About an hour
past noon we reached Villa Seca.</p>
<p>We found it a large village, containing about seven hundred
inhabitants, and surrounded by a mud wall.&nbsp; A <i>plaza</i>,
or market-place, stood in the midst, one side of which is
occupied by what is called a palace, a clumsy quadrangular
building of two stories, belonging to some noble family, the
lords of the neighbouring soil.&nbsp; It was deserted, however;
being only occupied by a kind of steward, who stored up in its
chambers the grain which he received as rent from the tenants and
<i>villanos</i> who farmed the surrounding district.</p>
<p>The village stands at the distance of about a quarter of a
league from the bank of the Tagus, which even here, in the heart
of Spain, is a beautiful stream, not navigable, however, on
account of the sand-banks, which in many places assume the
appearance of small islands, and are covered with trees and
brushwood.&nbsp; The village derives its supply of water entirely
from the river, having none of its own&mdash;such, at least, as
is potable&mdash;the water of its wells being all brackish, on
which account it is probably termed Villa Seca, which signifies
&ldquo;the dry hamlet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inhabitants are said to
have been originally Moors; certain it is, that various customs
are observable here highly favourable to such a
supposition.&nbsp; Amongst others, a very curious one: it is
deemed infamous for a woman of Villa Seca to go across the
market-place, or to be seen there, though they have no hesitation
in showing themselves in the streets and lanes.&nbsp; A
deep-rooted hostility exists between the inhabitants of this
place <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>and those of a neighbouring village, called Vargas;
they rarely speak when they meet, and never intermarry.&nbsp;
There is a vague tradition that the people of the latter place
are old Christians, and it is highly probable that these
neighbours were originally of widely different blood; those of
Villa Seca being of particularly dark complexions, whilst the
indwellers of Vargas are light and fair.&nbsp; Thus the old feud
between Moor and Christian is still kept up in the nineteenth
century in Spain.</p>
<p>Drenched in perspiration, which fell from our brows like rain,
we arrived at the door of Juan Lopez, the husband of Maria
Diaz.&nbsp; Having heard of our intention to pay him a visit, he
was expecting us, and cordially welcomed us to his habitation,
which, like a genuine Moorish house, consisted only of one
story.&nbsp; It was amply large, however, with a court and
stable.&nbsp; All the apartments were deliciously cool.&nbsp; The
floors were of brick or stone; and the narrow and trellised
windows, which were without glass, scarcely permitted a ray of
sun to penetrate into the interior.</p>
<p>A <i>puchera</i> had been prepared in expectation of our
arrival; the heat had not taken away my appetite, and it was not
long before I did full justice to this the standard dish of
Spain.&nbsp; Whilst I ate, Lopez played upon the guitar, singing
occasionally snatches of Andalusian songs.&nbsp; He was a short,
merry-faced, active fellow, whom I had frequently seen at Madrid,
and was a good specimen of the Spanish <i>labrador</i>, or
yeoman.&nbsp; Though far from possessing the ability and
intellect of his wife, Maria Diaz, he was by no means deficient
in shrewdness and understanding.&nbsp; He was, moreover, honest
and disinterested, and performed good service in the Gospel
cause, as will presently appear.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>When
the repast was concluded, Lopez thus addressed
me:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Don Jorge</i>, your arrival in
our village has already caused a sensation; more especially as
these are times of war and tumult, and every person is afraid of
another, and we dwell here close on the confines of the factious
country: for, as you well know, the greater part of La Mancha is
in the hands of the <i>Carlinos</i> and thieves, parties of whom
frequently show themselves on the other side of the river; on
which account the <i>alcalde</i> of this city, with the other
grave and notable people thereof, are desirous of seeing your
worship, and conversing with you, and of examining your
passport.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;let us forthwith pay a visit to these worthy
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon he conducted me across the
<i>plaza</i>, to the house of the <i>alcalde</i>, where I found
the rustic dignitary seated in the passage, enjoying the
refreshing coolness of a draught of air which rushed
through.&nbsp; He was an elderly man, of about sixty, with
nothing remarkable in his appearance or his features, which
latter were placid and good-humoured.&nbsp; There were several
people with him, amongst whom was the surgeon of the place, a
tall and immensely bulky man, an Alavese by birth, from the town
of Vitoria.&nbsp; There was also a red fiery-faced individual,
with a nose very much turned on one side, who was the blacksmith
of the village, and was called in general <i>El Tuerto</i>, <a
name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"
class="citation">[188]</a> from the circumstance of his having
but one eye.&nbsp; Making the assembly a low bow, I pulled out my
passport, and thus addressed them:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;Grave men and cavaliers of this city of Villa
Seca, as I am a stranger, of whom it is not possible that you
should know anything, I have deemed it my duty to present myself
before you, and to tell you who I am.&nbsp; Know, then, that I am
an Englishman of good blood and fathers, travelling in these
countries for my own profit and diversion, and for that of other
people also.&nbsp; I have now found my way to Villa Seca, where I
propose to stay some time, doing that which may be deemed
convenient; sometimes riding across the plain, and sometimes
bathing myself in the waters of the river, which are reported to
be of advantage in times of heat.&nbsp; I therefore beg that,
during my sojourn in this capital, I may enjoy such countenance
and protection from its governors as they are in the habit of
affording to those who are of quiet and well-ordered life, and
are disposed to be buxom and obedient to the customs and laws of
the republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks well,&rdquo; said the <i>alcalde</i>,
glancing around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he speaks well,&rdquo; said the bulky Alavese;
&ldquo;there is no denying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard any one speak better,&rdquo; cried the
blacksmith, starting up from a stool on which he was
seated.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Vaya</i>! he is a big man and a fair
complexioned, like myself.&nbsp; I like him, and have a horse
that will just suit him; one that is the flower of Spain, and is
eight inches above the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then, with another bow, presented my passport to the
<i>alcalde</i>, who, with a gentle motion of his hand, appeared
to decline taking it, at the same time saying, &ldquo;It is not
necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo; exclaimed
the surgeon.&nbsp; &ldquo;The housekeepers of Villa Seca know how
to comport themselves with formality,&rdquo; observed the
blacksmith.&nbsp; &ldquo;They would be very loth to harbour <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>any
suspicion against a cavalier so courteous and well
spoken.&rdquo;&nbsp; Knowing, however, that this refusal amounted
to nothing, and that it merely formed part of a polite
ceremonial, I proffered the passport a second time, whereupon it
was instantly taken, and in a moment the eyes of all present were
bent upon it with intense curiosity.&nbsp; It was examined from
top to bottom, and turned round repeatedly, and though it is not
probable that an individual present understood a word of it, it
being written in French, it gave nevertheless universal
satisfaction; and when the <i>alcalde</i>, carefully folding it
up, returned it to me, they all observed that they had never seen
a better passport in their lives, or one which spake in higher
terms of the bearer.</p>
<p>Who was it said that &ldquo;Cervantes sneered Spain&rsquo;s
chivalry away&rdquo;? <a name="citation190"></a><a
href="#footnote190" class="citation">[190]</a>&nbsp; I know not;
and the author of such a line scarcely deserves to be
remembered.&nbsp; How the rage for scribbling tempts people at
the present day to write about lands and nations of which they
know nothing, or worse than nothing!&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>!&nbsp; It
is not <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>from having seen a bull-fight at Seville or Madrid, or
having spent a handful of ounces at a <i>posada</i> in either of
those places, kept perhaps by a Genoese or a Frenchman, that you
are competent to write about such a people as the Spaniards, and
to tell the world how they think, how they speak, and how they
act.&nbsp; Spain&rsquo;s chivalry sneered away!&nbsp; Why, there
is every probability that the great body of the Spanish nation
speak, think, and live precisely as their forefathers did six
centuries ago.</p>
<p>In the evening the blacksmith, or, as he would be called in
Spanish, <i>El Herrador</i>, made his appearance at the door of
Lopez on horseback.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Vamos</i>, <i>Don
Jorge</i>,&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come with me, if your
worship is disposed for a ride.&nbsp; I am going to bathe my
horse in the Tagus, by the bridge of Azeca.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
instantly saddled my <i>jaca Cordovesa</i>, and joining him, we
rode out of the village, directing our course across the plain
towards the river.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever see such a horse as
this of mine, <i>Don Jorge</i>?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is he not a jewel&mdash;an <i>alhaja</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
in truth the horse was a noble and gallant creature, in height at
least sixteen hands, broad-chested, but of clean and elegant
limbs.&nbsp; His neck was superbly arched, and his head towered
on high like that of a swan.&nbsp; In colour he was a bright
chestnut, save his flowing mane and tail, which were almost
black.&nbsp; I expressed my admiration; whereupon the
<i>herrador</i>, in high spirits, pressed his heels to the
creature&rsquo;s sides, and flinging the bridle on its neck,
speeded over the plain with prodigious swiftness, shouting the
old Spanish cry, <i>Cierra</i>!&nbsp; I attempted to keep up with
him, but had not a chance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call him the flower of
Spain,&rdquo; said the <i>herrador</i>, rejoining me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Purchase him, <i>Don Jorge</i>; his price is but three <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>thousand
<i>reals</i>. <a name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192"
class="citation">[192]</a>&nbsp; I would not sell him for double
that sum, but the Carlist thieves have their eyes upon him, and I
am apprehensive that they will some day make a dash across the
river and break into Villa Seca, all to get possession of my
horse, &lsquo;The Flower of Spain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be as well to observe here, that, within a month from
this period, my friend the <i>herrador</i>, not being able to
find a regular purchaser for his steed, entered into negociations
with the aforesaid thieves respecting him, and finally disposed
of the animal to their leader, receiving not the three thousand
<i>reals</i> he demanded, but an entire herd of horned cattle,
probably driven from the plains of La Mancha.&nbsp; For this
transaction, which was neither more nor less than high treason,
he was cast into the prison of Toledo, where, however, he did not
continue long; for during a short visit to Villa Seca, which I
made in the spring of the following year, I found him
<i>alcalde</i> of that &ldquo;republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We arrived at the bridge of Azeca, which is about half a
league from Villa Seca: close beside it is a large water-mill,
standing upon a dam which crosses the river.&nbsp; Dismounting
from his steed, the <i>herrador</i> proceeded to divest it of the
saddle, then causing it to enter the mill-pool, he led it by
means of a cord to a particular spot, where the water reached
halfway up its neck, then fastening the cord to a post on the
bank, he left the animal standing in the pool.&nbsp; I thought I
could do no better than follow his example; and, accordingly,
procuring a rope from the mill, I led my own horse into the
water.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will refresh their blood, <i>Don
Jorge</i>,&rdquo;, said the <i>herrador</i>; &ldquo;let us leave
them there for an hour, whilst we go and divert
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Near
the bridge, on the side of the river on which we were, was a kind
of guard-house, where were three carbineers of the revenue, who
collected the tolls of the bridge.&nbsp; We entered into
conversation with them: &ldquo;Is not this a dangerous position
of yours,&rdquo; said I to one of them, who was a Catalan,
&ldquo;close beside the factious country?&nbsp; Surely it would
not be difficult for a body of the <i>Carlinos</i> or bandits to
dash across the bridge and make prisoners of you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be easy enough at any moment, cavalier,&rdquo;
replied the Catalan; &ldquo;we are, however, all in the hands of
God, and he has preserved us hitherto, and perhaps still
will.&nbsp; True it is that one of our number, for there were
four of us originally, fell the other day into the hands of the
<i>canaille</i>.&nbsp; He had wandered across the bridge amongst
the thickets with his gun in search of a hare or rabbit, when
three or four of them fell upon him and put him to death in a
manner too horrible to relate.&nbsp; But patience! every man who
lives must die.&nbsp; I shall not sleep the worse to-night
because I may chance to be hacked by the knives of these
<i>malvados</i> to-morrow.&nbsp; Cavalier, I am from Barcelona,
and have seen there mariners of your nation; this is not so good
a country as Barcelona.&nbsp; <i>Paciencia</i>!&nbsp; Cavalier,
if you will step into our house, I will give you a glass of
water; we have some that is cool, for we dug a deep hole in the
earth and buried there our pitcher; it is cool, as I told you,
but the water of Castile is not like that of
Catalonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon had arisen when we mounted our horses to return to
the village, and the rays of the beauteous luminary danced
merrily on the rushing waters of the Tagus, silvered the plain
over which we were passing, and bathed in a flood of brightness
the bold sides of <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>the calcareous hill of Villaluenga and the antique
ruins which crowned its brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why is that the Castle
of Villaluenga?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a village of that name, which stands on the other
side of the hill, <i>Don Jorge</i>,&rdquo; replied the
<i>herrador</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Vaya</i>! it is a strange place,
that castle: some say it was built by the Moors in the old times,
and some by the Christians when they first laid siege to
Toledo.&nbsp; It is not inhabited now, save by rabbits, which
breed there in abundance amongst the long grass and broken
stones, and by eagles and vultures, which build on the tops of
the towers.&nbsp; I occasionally go there with my gun to shoot a
rabbit.&nbsp; On a fine day you may descry both Toledo and Madrid
from its walls.&nbsp; I cannot say I like the place, it is so
dreary and melancholy.&nbsp; The hill on which it stands is all
of chalk, and is very difficult of ascent.&nbsp; I heard my
grandame say that once, when she was a girl, a cloud of smoke
burst from that hill, and that flames of fire were seen, just as
if it contained a volcano, as perhaps it does, <i>Don
Jorge</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grand work of Scripture circulation soon commenced in the
Sagra.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the heat of the weather, I rode
about in all directions.&nbsp; It was well that heat agrees with
my constitution, otherwise it would have been impossible to
effect anything in this season, when the very <i>arrieros</i>
frequently fall dead from their mules, smitten by a
sun-stroke.&nbsp; I had an excellent assistant in Antonio, who,
disregarding the heat like myself, and afraid of nothing, visited
several villages with remarkable success.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish to show you that
nothing is beyond my capacity.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he who put the
labours of us both to shame, was my host, Juan Lopez, whom it had
pleased <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>the Lord to render favourable to the cause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Don Jorge</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;<i>yo quiero
engancharme con usted</i>; <a name="citation195a"></a><a
href="#footnote195a" class="citation">[195a]</a> I am a liberal,
and a foe to superstition; I will take the field, and, if
necessary, will follow you to the end of the world: <i>Viva
Inglaterra</i>; <i>viva el Evangelio</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
saying, he put a large bundle of Testaments into a satchel, and,
springing upon the crupper of his grey donkey, he cried,
&ldquo;<i>Arrh&eacute;</i>! <i>burra</i>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b"
class="citation">[195b]</a> and hastened away.&nbsp; I sat down
to my journal.</p>
<p>Ere I had finished writing I heard the voice of the
<i>burra</i> in the courtyard, and going out, I found my host
returned.&nbsp; He had disposed of his whole cargo of twenty
Testaments at the village of Vargas, distant from Villa Seca
about a league.&nbsp; Eight poor harvest-men, who were refreshing
themselves at the door of a wine-house, purchased each a copy,
whilst the village schoolmaster secured the rest for the little
ones beneath his care, lamenting, at the same time, the great
difficulty he had long experienced in obtaining religious books,
owing to their scarcity and extravagant price.&nbsp; Many other
persons were also anxious to purchase Testaments, but Lopez was
unable to supply them: at his departure they requested him to
return within a few days.</p>
<p>I was aware that I was playing rather a daring game, and that
it was very possible that, when I least expected it, I might be
seized, tied to the tail of a mule, and dragged either to the
prison of Toledo or Madrid.&nbsp; Yet such a prospect did not
discourage me in the least, but rather urged me to persevere;
for, at this time, without the slightest wish to magnify myself,
<a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>I could
say that I was eager to lay down my life for the cause, and
whether a bandit&rsquo;s bullet or the gaol fever brought my
career to a close, was a matter of indifference to me; I was not
then a stricken man: &ldquo;Ride on, because of the word of
righteousness,&rdquo; was my cry.</p>
<p>The news of the arrival of the book of life soon spread like
wildfire through the villages of the Sagra of Toledo, and
wherever my people and myself directed our course we found the
inhabitants disposed to receive our merchandise; it was even
called for where not exhibited.&nbsp; One night as I was bathing
myself and horse in the Tagus, a knot of people gathered on the
bank, crying, &ldquo;Come out of the water, Englishman, and give
us books; we have got our money in our hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
poor creatures then held out their hands, filled with
<i>cuartos</i>, a copper coin of the value of a farthing, but
unfortunately I had no Testaments to give them.&nbsp; Antonio,
however, who was at a short distance, having exhibited one, it
was instantly torn from his hands by the people, and a scuffle
ensued to obtain possession of it.&nbsp; It very frequently
occurred that the poor labourers in the neighbourhood, being
eager to obtain Testaments, and having no money to offer us in
exchange, brought various articles to our habitation as
equivalents; for example, rabbits, fruit, and barley; and I made
a point never to disappoint them, as such articles were of
utility either for our own consumption or that of the horses.</p>
<p>In Villa Seca there was a school in which fifty-seven children
were taught the first rudiments of education.&nbsp; One morning
the schoolmaster, a tall slim figure of about sixty, bearing on
his head one of the peaked hats of Andalusia, and wrapped,
notwithstanding the <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>excessive heat of the weather, in a
long cloak, made his appearance, and having seated himself,
requested to be shown one of our books.&nbsp; Having delivered it
to him, he remained examining it for nearly an hour, without
uttering a word.&nbsp; At last he laid it down with a sigh, and
said that he should be very happy to purchase some of these books
for his school, but from their appearance, especially from the
quality of the paper and binding, he was apprehensive that to pay
for them would exceed the means of the parents of his pupils, as
they were almost destitute of money, being poor labourers.&nbsp;
He then commenced blaming the government, which, he said,
established schools without affording the necessary books, adding
that in his school there were but two books for the use of all
his pupils, and these, he confessed, contained but little
good.&nbsp; I asked him what he considered the Testaments were
worth?&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Cavalier, to
speak frankly, I have in other times paid twelve <i>reals</i> for
books inferior to yours in every respect; but I assure you that
my poor pupils would be utterly unable to pay the half of that
sum.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;I will sell you as many as
you please for three <i>reals</i> each.&nbsp; I am acquainted
with the poverty of the land, and my friends and myself, in
affording the people the means of spiritual instruction, have no
wish to curtail their scanty bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied,
&ldquo;<i>Bendito sea Dios</i>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197"
class="citation">[197]</a> and could scarcely believe his
ears.&nbsp; He instantly purchased a dozen, expending, as he
said, all the money he possessed, with the exception of a few
<i>cuartos</i>.&nbsp; The introduction of the Word of God into
the country schools of Spain is therefore begun, and I humbly
hope that it will prove one of those events which the Bible
Society, after the <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>lapse of years, will have most reason to remember with
joy and gratitude to the Almighty.</p>
<p>An old peasant is reading in the portico.&nbsp; Eighty-four
years have passed over his head, and he is almost entirely deaf;
nevertheless he is reading aloud the second of Matthew: three
days since he bespoke a Testament, but not being able to raise
the money, he has not redeemed it until the present moment.&nbsp;
He has just brought thirty farthings.&nbsp; As I survey the
silvery hair which overshadows his sun-burnt countenance, the
words of the song occurred to me, &ldquo;Lord, now lettest thou
thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes
have seen thy salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I experienced much grave kindness and simple hospitality from
the good people of Villa Seca during my sojourn amongst
them.&nbsp; I had at this time so won their hearts by the
&ldquo;formality&rdquo; of my behaviour and language, that I
firmly believe they would have resisted to the knife any attempt
which might have been made to arrest or otherwise maltreat
me.&nbsp; He who wishes to become acquainted with the genuine
Spaniard must seek him not in seaports and large towns, but in
lone and remote villages, like those of the Sagra.&nbsp; There he
will find all that gravity of deportment and chivalry of
disposition which Cervantes is said to have sneered away; <a
name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198"
class="citation">[198]</a> and there he will hear, in everyday
conversation, those grandiose expressions, which, when met with
in the romances of chivalry, are scoffed at as ridiculous
exaggerations.</p>
<p>I had one enemy in the village&mdash;it was the curate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow is a heretic and a scoundrel,&rdquo; said he
one day in the conclave.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never enters the church,
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>and is
poisoning the minds of the people with his Lutheran books.&nbsp;
Let him be bound and sent to Toledo, or turned out of the village
at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said the
<i>alcalde</i>, who was said to be a Carlist.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he
has his opinions, I have mine too.&nbsp; He has conducted himself
with politeness.&nbsp; Why should I interfere with him?&nbsp; He
has been courteous to my daughter, and has presented her with a
volume.&nbsp; <i>Que viva</i>! and with respect to his being a
Lutheran, I have heard say that amongst the Lutherans there are
sons of as good fathers as here.&nbsp; He appears to me a
<i>caballero</i>.&nbsp; He speaks well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no denying it,&rdquo; said the surgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who speaks <i>so</i> well?&rdquo; shouted the
<i>herrador</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who has more formality?&nbsp;
<i>Vaya</i>! did he not praise my horse, &lsquo;The Flower of
Spain&rsquo;?&nbsp; Did he not say that in the whole of
<i>Inglaterra</i> there was not a better?&nbsp; Did he not assure
me, moreover, that if he were to remain in Spain he would
purchase it, giving me my own price?&nbsp; Turn him out,
indeed!&nbsp; Is he not of my own blood, is he not
fair-complexioned?&nbsp; Who shall turn him out when I,
&lsquo;the one-eyed,&rsquo; say no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connexion with the circulation of the Scriptures I will now
relate an anecdote not altogether divested of singularity.&nbsp;
I have already spoken of the water-mill by the bridge of
Azeca.&nbsp; I had formed acquaintance with the tenant of this
mill, who was known in the neighbourhood by the name of Don
Antero.&nbsp; One day, taking me into a retired place, he asked
me, to my great astonishment, whether I would sell him a thousand
Testaments at the price at which I was disposing of them to the
peasantry; saying, if I would consent <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>he would pay me immediately.&nbsp;
In fact, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled it out
filled with gold ounces.&nbsp; I asked him what was his reason
for wishing to make so considerable a purchase.&nbsp; Whereupon
he informed me that he had a relation in Toledo whom he wished to
establish, and that he was of opinion that his best plan would be
to hire him a shop there and furnish it with Testaments.&nbsp; I
told him that he must think of nothing of the kind, as probably
the books would be seized on the first attempt to introduce them
into Toledo, as the priests and canons were much averse to their
distribution.</p>
<p>He was not disconcerted, however, and said his relation could
travel, as I myself was doing, and dispose of them to the
peasants with profit to himself.&nbsp; I confess I was inclined
at first to accept his offer, but at length declined it, as I did
not wish to expose a poor man to the risk of losing money, goods,
and perhaps liberty and life.&nbsp; I was likewise averse to the
books being offered to the peasantry at an advanced price, being
aware that they could not afford it, and the books, by such an
attempt, would lose a considerable part of that influence which
they then enjoyed; for their cheapness struck the minds of the
people, and they considered it almost as much in the light of a
miracle as the Jews the manna which dropped from heaven at the
time they were famishing, or the spring which suddenly gushed
from the flinty rock to assuage their thirst in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>At this time a peasant was continually passing and repassing
between Villa Seca and Madrid, bringing us cargoes of Testaments
on a <i>borrico</i>.&nbsp; We continued our labours until the
greater part of the villages of the Sagra were well supplied with
books, more especially <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>those of Vargas, Coveja, Mocejon,
Villaluenga, Villa Seca, and Yuncler. <a
name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a>&nbsp; Hearing at last that our
proceedings were known at Toledo, and were causing considerable
alarm, we returned to Madrid.</p>
<h2><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Aranjuez&mdash;A Warning&mdash;A Night
Adventure&mdash;A Fresh
Expedition&mdash;Segovia&mdash;Abades&mdash;Factious
Curas&mdash;Lopez in Prison&mdash;Rescue of Lopez.</p>
<p>The success which had attended our efforts in the Sagra of
Toledo speedily urged me on to a new enterprise.&nbsp; I now
determined to direct my course to La Mancha, and to distribute
the Word amongst the villages of that province.&nbsp; Lopez, who
had already performed such important services in the Sagra, had
accompanied us to Madrid, and was eager to take part in this new
expedition.&nbsp; We determined in the first place to proceed to
Aranjuez, where we hoped to obtain some information which might
prove of utility in the further regulation of our movements;
Aranjuez being but a slight distance from the frontier of La
Mancha, and the high-road into that province passing directly
through it.&nbsp; We accordingly sallied forth from Madrid,
selling from twenty to forty Testaments in every village which
lay in our way, until we arrived at Aranjuez, to which place we
had forwarded a large supply of books.</p>
<p>A lovely spot is Aranjuez, <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a> though in
desolation: here the Tagus flows through a delicious valley, <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>perhaps the
most fertile in Spain; and here upsprang, in Spain&rsquo;s better
days, a little city, with a small but beautiful palace, shaded by
enormous trees, where royalty delighted to forget its
cares.&nbsp; Here Ferdinand the Seventh spent his latter days,
surrounded by lovely <i>se&ntilde;oras</i> and Andalusian
bull-fighters; but, as the German Schiller has it in one of his
tragedies&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The happy days in fair Aranjuez<br />
Are past and gone.&rdquo; <a name="citation203"></a><a
href="#footnote203" class="citation">[203]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the sensual king went to his dread account, royalty
deserted it, and it soon fell into decay.&nbsp; Intriguing
courtiers no longer crowd its halls; its spacious circus, where
Manchegan bulls once roared in rage and agony, is now closed, and
the light tinkling of guitars is no longer heard amidst its
groves and gardens.</p>
<p>At Aranjuez I made a sojourn of three days, during which time
Antonio, Lopez, and myself visited every house in the town.&nbsp;
We found a vast deal of poverty and ignorance amongst the
inhabitants, and experienced some opposition: nevertheless it
pleased the Almighty to permit us to dispose of about eighty
Testaments, which were purchased entirely by the very poor
people; those in easier circumstances paying no attention to the
Word of God, but rather turning it to scoff and ridicule.</p>
<p>One circumstance was very gratifying and cheering to me,
namely, the ocular proof which I possessed that the books which I
disposed of were read, and with attention, by those to whom I
sold them; and that many others participated in their
benefit.&nbsp; In the streets of Aranjuez, and beneath the mighty
cedars <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>and gigantic elms and plantains which compose its noble
woods, I have frequently seen groups assembled listening to
individuals who, with the New Testament in their hands, were
reading aloud the comfortable words of salvation.</p>
<p>It is probable that, had I remained a longer period at
Aranjuez, I might have sold many more of these Divine books, but
I was eager to gain La Mancha and its sandy plains, and to
conceal myself for a season amongst its solitary villages, for I
was apprehensive that a storm was gathering around me; but when
once through Oca&ntilde;a, the frontier town, I knew well that I
should have nothing to fear from the Spanish authorities, as
their power ceased there, the rest of La Mancha being almost
entirely in the hands of the Carlists, and overrun by small
parties of banditti, from whom, however, I trusted that the Lord
would preserve me.&nbsp; I therefore departed for Oca&ntilde;a,
<a name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a> distant three leagues from
Aranjuez.</p>
<p>I started with Antonio at six in the evening, having early in
the morning sent forward Lopez with between two and three hundred
Testaments.&nbsp; We left the highroad, and proceeded by a
shorter way through wild hills and over very broken and
precipitous ground.&nbsp; Being well mounted, we found ourselves
just after sunset opposite Oca&ntilde;a, which stands on a steep
hill.&nbsp; A deep valley lay between us and the town: we
descended, and came to a small bridge, which traverses a rivulet
at the bottom of the valley, at a very small distance from a kind
of suburb.&nbsp; We crossed the bridge, and were passing by a
deserted house on our left hand, when a man appeared from under
the porch.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>What
I am about to state will seem incomprehensible, but a singular
history and a singular people are connected with it: the man
placed himself before my horse so as to bar the way, and said,
&ldquo;<i>Schophon</i>,&rdquo; which, in the Hebrew tongue,
signifies a rabbit. <a name="citation205"></a><a
href="#footnote205" class="citation">[205]</a>&nbsp; I knew this
word to be one of the Jewish countersigns, and asked the man if
he had anything to communicate?&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;You must
not enter the town, for a net is prepared for you.&nbsp; The
<i>corregidor</i> of Toledo, on whom may all evil light, in order
to give pleasure to the priests of Maria, in whose face I spit,
has ordered all the <i>alcaldes</i> of these parts, and the
<i>escribanos</i> and the <i>corchetes</i> to lay hands on you
wherever they may find you, and to send you, and your books, and
all that pertains to you to Toledo.&nbsp; Your servant was seized
this morning in the town above, as he was selling the writings in
the streets, and they are now awaiting your arrival in the
<i>posada</i>; but I knew you from the accounts of my brethren,
and I have been waiting here four hours to give you warning in
order that your horse may turn his tail to your enemies, and
neigh in derision of them.&nbsp; Fear nothing for your servant,
for he is known to the <i>alcalde</i>, and will be set at
liberty; but do you flee, and may God attend you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Having said this, he hurried towards the town.</p>
<p>I hesitated not a moment to take his advice, knowing full well
that, as my books had been taken possession of, I could do no
more in that quarter.&nbsp; We turned back in the direction of
Aranjuez, the horses, notwithstanding the nature of the ground,
galloping at full speed; but our adventures were not over.&nbsp;
Midway, and about half a league from the village of <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>Antigola,
we saw close to us on our left hand three men on a low
bank.&nbsp; As far as the darkness would permit us to
distinguish, they were naked, but each bore in his hand a long
gun.&nbsp; These were <i>rateros</i>, or the common assassins and
robbers of the roads.&nbsp; We halted and cried out, &ldquo;Who
goes there?&rdquo;&nbsp; They replied, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that
to you? pass by.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their drift was to fire at us from
a position from which it would be impossible to miss.&nbsp; We
shouted, &ldquo;If you do not instantly pass to the right side of
the road we will tread you down beneath the horses&rsquo;
hoofs.&rdquo;&nbsp; They hesitated and then obeyed, for all
assassins are dastards, and the least show of resolution daunts
them.&nbsp; As we galloped past, one cried, with an obscene oath,
&ldquo;Shall we fire?&rdquo;&nbsp; But another said, &ldquo;No,
no! there&rsquo;s danger.&rdquo;&nbsp; We reached Aranjuez, where
early next morning Lopez rejoined us, and we returned to
Madrid.</p>
<p>I am sorry to state that two hundred Testaments were seized at
Oca&ntilde;a, from whence, after being sealed up, they were
despatched to Toledo.&nbsp; Lopez informed me, that in two hours
he could have sold them all, the demand was so great.&nbsp; As it
was, twenty-seven were disposed of in less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride on, because of the word of
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the check which we
had experienced at Oca&ntilde;a, we were far from being
discouraged, and forthwith prepared ourselves for another
expedition.&nbsp; As we returned from Aranjuez to Madrid, my eyes
had frequently glanced towards the mighty wall of mountains
dividing the two Castiles, and I said to myself, &ldquo;Would it
not be well to cross those hills, and commence operations on the
other side, even in Old Castile?&nbsp; There I am unknown, and
intelligence of my proceedings can scarcely have been transmitted
<a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>thither.&nbsp; Peradventure the enemy is asleep, and
before he has roused himself, I may have sown much of the
precious seed amongst the villages of the Old Castilians.&nbsp;
To Castile, therefore, to <i>Castilla la Vieja</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Accordingly, on the day after my arrival, I despatched several
cargoes of books to various places which I proposed to visit, and
sent forward Lopez and his donkey, well laden, with directions to
meet me on a particular day beneath a particular arch of the
aqueduct of Segovia.&nbsp; I likewise gave him orders to engage
any persons willing to co-operate with us in the circulation of
the Scriptures, and who might be likely to prove of utility in
the enterprise.&nbsp; A more useful assistant than Lopez in an
expedition of this kind it was impossible to have.&nbsp; He was
not only well acquainted with the country, but had friends, and
even connexions on the other side of the hills, in whose houses
he assured me that we should at all times find a hearty
welcome.&nbsp; He departed in high spirits, exclaiming, &ldquo;Be
of good cheer, <i>Don Jorge</i>; before we return we will have
disposed of every copy of your evangelic library.&nbsp; Down with
the friars!&nbsp; Down with superstition!&nbsp; <i>Viva
Inglaterra</i>, <i>viva el Evangelio</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few days I followed with Antonio.&nbsp; We ascended the
mountains by the pass called Pe&ntilde;a Cerrada, which lies
about three leagues to the eastward of that of Guadarrama.&nbsp;
It is very unfrequented, the high road between the two Castiles
passing through Guadarrama.&nbsp; It has, moreover, an evil name,
being, according to common report, infested with banditti.&nbsp;
The sun was just setting when we reached the top of the hills,
and entered a thick and gloomy pine forest, which entirely covers
the mountains on the side of Old Castile.&nbsp; The descent soon
became so rapid and <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>precipitous, that we were fain to
dismount from our horses and to drive them before us.&nbsp; Into
the woods we plunged deeper and deeper still; night-birds soon
began to hoot and cry, and millions of crickets commenced their
shrill chirping above, below, and around us.&nbsp; Occasionally,
amidst the trees at a distance, we could see blazes, as if from
immense fires.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are those of the
charcoal-burners, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio;
&ldquo;we will not go near them, however, for they are savage
people, and half bandits.&nbsp; Many is the traveller whom they
have robbed and murdered in these horrid wildernesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was blackest night when we arrived at the foot of the
mountains; we were still, however, amidst woods and pine forests,
which extended for leagues in every direction.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
shall scarcely reach Segovia to-night, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio.&nbsp; And so indeed it
proved, for we became bewildered, and at last arrived where two
roads branched off in different directions: we took not the
left-hand road, which would have conducted us to Segovia, but
turned to the right, in the direction of La Granja, where we
arrived at midnight.</p>
<p>We found the desolation of La Granja <a
name="citation208"></a><a href="#footnote208"
class="citation">[208]</a> far greater than that of Aranjuez;
both had suffered from the absence of royalty, but the former to
a degree which was truly appalling.&nbsp; Nine-tenths of the
inhabitants had left this place, which, until the late military
revolution, had been the favourite residence of Christina.&nbsp;
So great is the solitude of La Granja, that wild <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>boars from
the neighbouring forests, and especially from the beautiful
pine-covered mountain which rises like a cone directly behind the
palace, frequently find their way into the streets and squares,
and whet their tusks against the pillars of the porticos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride on, because of the word of
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a stay of twenty-four hours at
La Granja, we proceeded to Segovia.&nbsp; The day had arrived on
which I had appointed to meet Lopez.&nbsp; I repaired to the
aqueduct, and sat down beneath the hundred and seventh arch,
where I waited the greater part of the day, but he came not,
whereupon I arose and went into the city.</p>
<p>At Segovia I tarried two days in the house of a friend; still
I could hear nothing of Lopez.&nbsp; At last, by the greatest
chance in the world, I heard from a peasant that there were men
in the neighbourhood of Abades selling books.</p>
<p>Abades is about three leagues distant from Segovia, and upon
receiving this intelligence, I instantly departed for the former
place, with three donkeys laden with Testaments.&nbsp; I reached
Abades at nightfall, and found Lopez, with two peasants whom he
had engaged, in the house of the surgeon of the place, where I
also took up my residence.&nbsp; He had already disposed of a
considerable number of Testaments in the neighbourhood, and had
that day commenced selling at Abades itself.&nbsp; He had,
however, been interrupted by two of the three <i>curas</i> of the
village, who, with horrid curses, denounced the work, threatening
eternal condemnation to Lopez for selling it, and to any person
who should purchase it; whereupon Lopez, terrified, forbore until
I should arrive.&nbsp; The third <i>cura</i>, however, exerted
himself to the utmost to persuade the people <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>to provide
themselves with Testaments, telling them that his brethren were
hypocrites and false guides, who, by keeping them in ignorance of
the word and will of Christ, were leading them to the
abyss.&nbsp; Upon receiving this information, I instantly sallied
forth to the market-place, and that same night succeeded in
disposing of upwards of thirty Testaments.&nbsp; The next morning
the house was entered by the two factious <i>curas</i>; but upon
my rising to confront them, they retreated, and I heard no more
of them, except that they publicly cursed me in the church more
than once, an event which, as no ill resulted from it, gave me
little concern.</p>
<p>I will not detail the events of the next week; suffice it to
say that, arranging my forces in the most advantageous way, I
succeeded, by God&rsquo;s assistance, in disposing of from five
to six hundred Testaments amongst the villages from one to seven
leagues&rsquo; distance from Abades.&nbsp; At the expiration of
that period I received information that my proceedings were known
in Segovia, in which province Abades is situated, and that an
order was about to be sent to the <i>alcalde</i> to seize all
books in my possession.&nbsp; Whereupon, notwithstanding that it
was late in the evening, I decamped with all my people, and
upwards of three hundred Testaments, having a few hours
previously received a fresh supply from Madrid.&nbsp; That night
we passed in the fields, and next morning proceeded to Labajos, a
village on the high-road from Madrid to Valladolid.&nbsp; In this
place we offered no books for sale, but contented ourselves with
supplying the neighbouring villages with the Word of God; we
likewise sold it in the highways.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>We had not been at Labajos a week, during which <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>time we
were remarkably successful, when the Carlist chieftain,
Balmaseda, <a name="citation211a"></a><a href="#footnote211a"
class="citation">[211a]</a> at the head of his cavalry, made his
desperate inroad into the southern part of Old Castile, dashing
down like an avalanche from the pine-woods of Soria.&nbsp; I was
present at all the horrors which ensued,&mdash;the sack of
Arrevalo, and the forcible entry into Martin Mu&ntilde;oz.&nbsp;
Amidst these terrible scenes we continued our labours.&nbsp;
Suddenly I lost Lopez for three days, and suffered dreadful
anxiety on his account, imagining that he had been shot by the
Carlists; at last I heard that he was in prison at Villallos,
three leagues distant.&nbsp; The steps which I took to rescue him
will be found detailed in a communication, which I deemed it my
duty to transmit to Lord William Hervey, who, in the absence of
Sir George Villiers, <a name="citation211b"></a><a
href="#footnote211b" class="citation">[211b]</a> now become Earl
of Clarendon, fulfilled the duties of minister at
Madrid:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Labajos, Province
of Segovia,<br />
&ldquo;August 23rd, 1838.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg leave to call your attention to the following
facts.&nbsp; On the 21st inst. I received information that a
person in my employ, of the name of Juan Lopez, had been thrown
into the prison of Villallos, in the province of Avila, by order
of the <i>cura</i> of that place.&nbsp; The crime with which he
was charged was selling the New Testament.&nbsp; I was at that
time at Labajos, in the province of Segovia, and the division of
the factious chieftain Balmaseda was in the immediate
neighbourhood.&nbsp; On the 22nd, I mounted my <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>horse and
rode to Villallos, a distance of three leagues.&nbsp; On my
arrival there, I found that Lopez had been removed from the
prison to a private house.&nbsp; An order had arrived from the
<i>corregidor</i> of Avila, commanding that the person of Lopez
should be set at liberty, and that the books which had been found
in his possession should be alone detained.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
in direct opposition to this order (a copy of which I herewith
transmit), the <i>alcalde</i> of Villallos, at the instigation of
the <i>cura</i>, refused to permit the said Lopez to quit the
place, either to proceed to Avila or in any other
direction.&nbsp; It had been hinted to Lopez that as the factious
were expected, it was intended on their arrival to denounce him
to them as a liberal, and to cause him to be sacrificed.&nbsp;
Taking these circumstances into consideration, I deemed it my
duty, as a Christian and a gentleman, to rescue my unfortunate
servant from such lawless hands, and in consequence, defying
opposition, I bore him off, though entirely unarmed, through a
crowd of at least one hundred peasants.&nbsp; On leaving the
place I shouted, &lsquo;<i>Viva Isabel Segunda</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is my belief that the <i>cura</i> of Villallos is

<p>After the rescue of Lopez we proceeded in the work of
distribution.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, the symptoms of <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>an
approaching illness came over me, which compelled us to return in
all haste to Madrid.&nbsp; Arrived there, I was attacked by a
fever which confined me to my bed for several weeks; occasional
fits of delirium came over me, during one of which I imagined
myself in the market-place of Martin Mu&ntilde;oz, engaged in
deadly struggle with the chieftain Balmaseda.</p>
<p>The fever had scarcely departed, when a profound melancholy
took possession of me, which entirely disqualified me for active
exertion.&nbsp; Change of scene and air was recommended; I
therefore returned to England. <a name="citation213"></a><a

<p class="gutsumm">Return to Spain&mdash;Seville&mdash;A Hoary
Persecutor&mdash;Manchegan Prophetess&mdash;Antonio&rsquo;s
Dream.</p>
<p>On December 31, 1838, I again visited Spain for the third
time.&nbsp; After staying a day or two at Cadiz, I repaired to
Seville, from which place I proposed starting for Madrid with the
mail post.&nbsp; Here I tarried about a fortnight, enjoying the
delicious climate of this terrestrial paradise, and the balmy
breezes of the Andalusian winter, even as I had done two years
previously.&nbsp; Before leaving Seville I visited the
bookseller, my correspondent, who informed me that seventy-six
copies of the hundred Testaments entrusted to his care had been
placed in embargo by the government last summer, and that they
were at the present time in possession of the ecclesiastical
governor; whereupon I determined to visit this functionary also,
with the view of making inquiries concerning the property.</p>
<p>He lived in a large house in the <i>Pajaria</i>, or
straw-market.&nbsp; He was a very old man, between seventy and
eighty, and, like the generality of those who wear the sacerdotal
habit in this city, was a fierce persecuting Papist.&nbsp; I
imagine that he scarcely believed his ears when his two
grand-nephews, beautiful black-haired boys who were playing in
the courtyard, ran to inform <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>him that an Englishman was waiting
to speak with him, as it is probable that I was the first heretic
who ever ventured into his habitation.&nbsp; I found him in a
vaulted room, seated on a lofty chair, with two sinister-looking
secretaries, also in sacerdotal habits, employed in writing at a
table before him.&nbsp; He brought powerfully to my mind the grim
old inquisitor who persuaded Philip the Second to slay his own
son <a name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a> as an enemy to the Church.</p>
<p>He rose as I entered, and gazed upon me with a countenance
dark with suspicion and dissatisfaction.&nbsp; He at last
condescended to point me to a sofa, and I proceeded to state to
him my business.&nbsp; He became much agitated when I mentioned
the Testaments to him; but I no sooner spoke of the Bible Society
and told him who I was, than he could contain himself no longer:
with a stammering tongue, and with eyes flashing fire like hot
coals, he proceeded to rail against the society and myself,
saying that the aims of the first were atrocious, and that, as to
myself, he was surprised that, being once lodged in the prison of
Madrid, I had ever been permitted to quit it; adding, that it was
disgraceful in the government to allow a person of my character
to roam about an innocent and peaceful country, corrupting the
minds of the ignorant and unsuspicious.&nbsp; Far from allowing
myself to be disconcerted by his rude behaviour, I replied to him
with all possible politeness, and assured him that in this
instance he had no reason to alarm himself, as my sole motive in
claiming the books in question was to avail myself of an
opportunity which at present presented itself, of sending them
out of the country, which, indeed, I had been commanded to do by
an official notice.&nbsp; But nothing would soothe him, and he <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>informed me
that he should not deliver up the books on any condition, save by
a positive order of the government.&nbsp; As the matter was by no
means an affair of consequence, I thought it wise not to persist,
and also prudent to take my leave before he requested me.&nbsp; I
was followed even down into the street by his niece and
grand-nephews, who, during the whole of the conversation, had
listened at the door of the apartment and heard every word.</p>
<p>In passing through La Mancha, we stayed for four hours at
Manzanares, a large village.&nbsp; I was standing in the
market-place conversing with a curate, when a frightful ragged
object presented itself; it was a girl about eighteen or
nineteen, perfectly blind, a white film being spread over her
huge staring eyes.&nbsp; Her countenance was as yellow as that of
a Mulatto.&nbsp; I thought at first that she was a gypsy, and
addressing myself to her, inquired in <i>Gitano</i> if she were
of that race.&nbsp; She understood me, but shaking her head,
replied, that she was something better than a <i>Gitana</i>, and
could speak something better than that jargon of witches:
whereupon she commenced asking me several questions in
exceedingly good Latin.&nbsp; I was of course very much
surprised, but, summoning all my Latinity, I called her Manchegan
Prophetess, and, expressing my admiration for her learning,
begged to be informed by what means she became possessed of
it.&nbsp; I must here observe that a crowd instantly gathered
around us, who, though they understood not one word of our
discourse, at every sentence of the girl shouted applause, proud
in the possession of a prophetess who could answer the
Englishman.</p>
<p>She informed me that she was born blind, and that a Jesuit
priest had taken compassion on her when she <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>was a
child, and had taught her the holy language, in order that the
attention and hearts of Christians might be more easily turned
towards her.&nbsp; I soon discovered that he had taught her
something more than Latin, for upon telling her that I was an
Englishman, she said that she had always loved Britain, which was
once the nursery of saints and sages; for example, Bede and
Alcuin, Columbus and Thomas of Canterbury; but, she added, those
times had gone by since the reappearance of Semiramis
(Elizabeth).&nbsp; Her Latin was truly excellent, and when I,
like a genuine Goth, spoke of Anglia and Terra Vandalica
(Andalusia), <a name="citation217"></a><a href="#footnote217"
class="citation">[217]</a> she corrected me by saying, that in
her language those places were called Britannia and Terra
Betica.&nbsp; When we had finished our discourse, a gathering was
made for the prophetess, the very poorest contributing
something.</p>
<p>After travelling four days and nights, we arrived at Madrid
without having experienced the slightest accident, though it is
but just to observe, and always with gratitude to the Almighty,
that the next mail was stopped.&nbsp; A singular incident befell
me immediately after my arrival.&nbsp; On entering the arch of
the <i>posada</i> called La Reyna, where I intended to put up, I
found myself encircled in a person&rsquo;s arms, and on turning
round in amazement, beheld my Greek servant, <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>Antonio.&nbsp; He was haggard and ill-dressed, and his
eyes seemed starting from their sockets.</p>
<p>As soon as we were alone he informed me that since my
departure he had undergone great misery and destitution, having,
during the whole period, been unable to find a master in need of
his services, so that he was brought nearly to the verge of
desperation; but that on the night immediately preceding my
arrival he had a dream, in which he saw me, mounted on a black
horse, ride up to the gate of the <i>posada</i>, and that on that
account he had been waiting there during the greater part of the
day.&nbsp; I do not pretend to offer an opinion concerning this
narrative, which is beyond the reach of my philosophy, and shall
content myself with observing, that only two individuals in
Madrid were aware of my arrival in Spain.&nbsp; I was very glad
to receive him again into my service, as, notwithstanding his
faults, he had in many instances proved of no slight assistance
to me in my wanderings and Biblical labours.</p>
<p>I was soon settled in my former lodgings, when one of my first
cares was to pay a visit to Lord Clarendon. <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a>&nbsp; Amongst other things, he
informed me that he had received an official notice from the
government, stating the seizure of the New Testaments at
Oca&ntilde;a, the circumstances relating to which I have
described on a former occasion, and informing him that unless
steps were instantly taken to remove them from the country, they
would be destroyed at Toledo, to which place they had been
conveyed.&nbsp; I replied that I should give myself no trouble
about the matter; and that if the authorities of Toledo, civil or
ecclesiastic, <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>determined upon burning these books, my only hope was
that they would commit them to the flames with all possible
publicity, as by so doing they would but manifest their own
hellish rancour and their hostility to the Word of God.</p>
<p>Being eager to resume my labours, I had no sooner arrived at
Madrid than I wrote to Lopez at Villa Seca, for the purpose of
learning whether he was inclined to co-operate in the work, as on
former occasions.&nbsp; In reply he informed me that he was
busily employed in his agricultural pursuits: to supply his
place, however, he sent over an elderly villager, Victoriano
Lopez by name, a distant relation of his own.</p>
<p>What is a missionary in the heart of Spain without a
horse?&nbsp; Which consideration induced me now to purchase an
Arabian of high caste, which had been brought from Algiers by an
officer of the French legion.&nbsp; The name of this steed, the
best, I believe, that ever issued from the desert, was Sidi
Habismilk. <a name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"

<p>In my last chapter I stated that, immediately after my arrival
at Madrid, I proceeded to get everything in readiness for
commencing operations in the neighbourhood: and I soon entered
upon my labours in reality.&nbsp; Considerable success attended
my feeble efforts in the good cause, for which at present, after
the lapse of some years, I still look back with gratitude to the
Almighty.</p>
<p>All the villages within the distance of four leagues to the
east of Madrid were visited in less than a fortnight, and
Testaments to the number of nearly two hundred disposed of.&nbsp;
These villages for the most part are very small, some of them
consisting of not more than a dozen houses, or I should rather
say miserable cabins.&nbsp; I left Antonio, my Greek, to
superintend matters in Madrid, and proceeded with Victoriano, the
peasant, from Villa Seca, in the direction which I have already
mentioned.&nbsp; We, however, soon parted company and pursued
different routes.</p>
<p>The first village at which I made an attempt was <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>Cobe&ntilde;a, about three leagues from Madrid.&nbsp; I
was dressed in the fashion of the peasants in the neighbourhood
of Segovia, in Old Castile, namely, I had on my head a species of
leather helmet or <i>montera</i>, with a jacket and trousers of
the same material.&nbsp; I had the appearance of a person between
sixty and seventy years of age, and drove before me a
<i>borrico</i> with a sack of Testaments lying across its
back.&nbsp; On nearing the village, I met a genteel-looking young
woman leading a little boy by the hand.&nbsp; As I was about to
pass her, with the customary salutation of <i>vaya usted con
Dios</i>, she stopped, and, after looking at me for a moment, she
said, &ldquo;Uncle, <a name="citation221a"></a><a
href="#footnote221a" class="citation">[221a]</a> what is that you
have got on your <i>borrico</i>?&nbsp; Is it soap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;it is soap to wash souls
clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She demanded what I meant; whereupon I told her that I carried
cheap and godly books for sale.&nbsp; On her requesting to see
one, I produced a copy from my pocket and handed it to her.&nbsp;
She instantly commenced reading with a loud voice, and continued
so for at least ten minutes, occasionally exclaiming,
&ldquo;<i>Que lectura tan bonita</i>, <i>que lectura tan
linda</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation221b"></a><a
href="#footnote221b" class="citation">[221b]</a>&nbsp; At last,
on my informing her that I was in a hurry, and could not wait any
longer, she said, &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; and asked me the
price of the book; I told her &ldquo;But three
<i>reals</i>,&rdquo; whereupon she said, that though what I asked
was very little, it was more than she could afford to give, as
there was little or no money in those parts.&nbsp; I said I was
sorry for it, but that I could not dispose of the books for less
than I had demanded, and accordingly, resuming it, wished her
farewell, and left her.&nbsp; <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>I had not, however, proceeded thirty
yards, when the boy came running behind me, shouting, out of
breath, &ldquo;Stop, uncle, the book, the book!&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon
overtaking me, he delivered the three <i>reals</i> in copper, and
seizing the Testament, ran back to her, who I suppose was his
sister, flourishing the book over his head with great glee.</p>
<p>On arriving at the village, I directed my steps to a house,
around the door of which I saw several people gathered, chiefly
women.&nbsp; On my displaying my books, their curiosity was
instantly aroused, and every person had speedily one in his hand,
many reading aloud; however, after waiting nearly an hour, I had
disposed of but one copy, all complaining bitterly of the
distress of the times, and the almost total want of money,
though, at the same time, they acknowledged that the books were
wonderfully cheap, and appeared to be very good and
Christian-like.&nbsp; I was about to gather up my merchandise and
depart, when on a sudden the curate of the place made his
appearance.&nbsp; After having examined the books for some time
with considerable attention, he asked me the price of a copy, and
upon my informing him that it was three <i>reals</i>, he replied
that the binding was worth more, and that he was much afraid that
I had stolen the books, and that it was perhaps his duty to send
me to prison as a suspicious character; but added, that the books
were good books, however they might be obtained, and concluded by
purchasing two copies.&nbsp; The poor people no sooner heard
their curate recommend the volumes, than all were eager to secure
one, and hurried here and there for the purpose of procuring
money, so that between twenty and thirty copies were sold almost
in an instant.&nbsp; This adventure not only affords an <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>instance of
the power still possessed by the Spanish clergy over the minds of
the people, but proves that such influence is not always exerted
in a manner favourable to the maintenance of ignorance and
superstition.</p>
<p>In another village, on my showing a Testament to a woman, she
said that she had a child at school for whom she should like to
purchase one, but that she must first know whether the book was
calculated to be of service to him.&nbsp; She then went away, and
presently returned with the schoolmaster, followed by all the
children under his care; she then, showing the schoolmaster a
book, inquired if it would answer for her son.&nbsp; The
schoolmaster called her a simpleton for asking such a question,
and said that he knew the book well, and there was not its equal
in the world. <a name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223"
class="citation">[223]</a>&nbsp; He instantly purchased five
copies for his pupils, regretting that he had no more money,
&ldquo;for if I had,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would buy the whole
cargo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon hearing this, the woman purchased four
copies, namely, one for her living son, another for her
<i>deceased husband</i>, a third for herself, and a fourth for
her brother, whom she said she was expecting home that night from
Madrid.</p>
<p>In this manner we proceeded; not, however, with uniform
success.&nbsp; In some villages the people were so poor and needy
that they had literally no money; even in these, however, we
managed to dispose of a few copies in exchange for barley or
refreshments.&nbsp; On entering one very small hamlet, Victoriano
was stopped by the curate, who, on learning what he carried, told
him, that unless he instantly departed, he would cause him to be
imprisoned, and would write to Madrid in order to give
information of what <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>was going on.&nbsp; The excursion
lasted about eight days.&nbsp; Immediately after my return, I
despatched Victoriano to Caramanchel, <a
name="citation224a"></a><a href="#footnote224a"
class="citation">[224a]</a> a village at a short distance from
Madrid, the only one towards the west which had not been visited
last year.&nbsp; He stayed there about an hour, and disposed of
twelve copies, and then returned, as he was exceedingly timid,
and was afraid of being met by the thieves who swarm on that road
in the evening.</p>
<p>Shortly after these events, a circumstance occurred which
will, perhaps, cause the English reader to smile, whilst, at the
same time, it will not fail to prove interesting, as affording an
example of the feeling prevalent in some of the lone villages of
Spain with respect to innovation and all that savours thereof,
and the strange acts which are sometimes committed by the rural
authorities and the priests, without the slightest fear of being
called to account; for as they live quite apart from the rest of
the world, they know no people greater than themselves, and
scarcely dream of a higher power than their own. <a
name="citation224b"></a><a href="#footnote224b"
class="citation">[224b]</a></p>
<p>I was about to make an excursion to Guadalajara, and the
villages of Alcarria, about seven leagues distant from Madrid;
indeed, I merely awaited the return of Victoriano to sally forth;
I having despatched him in that direction with a few Testaments,
as a kind of explorer, in order that, from his report as to the
disposition manifested by the people for purchasing, I might form
a tolerably accurate opinion as to the number of copies which it
might be necessary to carry with me.&nbsp; However, I heard
nothing of him for a fortnight, at the end of which period a
letter was brought <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>to me by a peasant, dated from the prison of Fuente la
Higuera, a village eight leagues from Madrid, in the
<i>campi&ntilde;a</i> of Alcal&aacute;: <a
name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225"
class="citation">[225]</a> this letter, written by Victoriano,
gave me to understand that he had been already eight days
imprisoned, and that unless I could find some means to extricate
him, there was every probability of his remaining in durance
until he should perish with hunger, which he had no doubt would
occur as soon as his money was exhausted.&nbsp; From what I
afterwards learned, it appeared that, after passing the town of
Alcal&aacute;, he had commenced distributing, and with
considerable success.&nbsp; His entire stock consisted of
sixty-one Testaments, twenty-five of which he sold without the
slightest difficulty or interruption in the single village of
Arganza; the poor labourers showering blessings on his head for
providing them with such good books at an easy price.</p>
<p>Not more than eighteen of his books remained, when he turned
off the high-road towards Fuente la Higuera.&nbsp; This place was
already tolerably well known to him, he having visited it of old,
when he travelled the country in the capacity of a vender of
<i>cacharras</i>, or earthen pans.&nbsp; He subsequently stated
that he felt some misgiving whilst on the way, as the village had
invariably borne a bad reputation.&nbsp; On his arrival, after
having put up his <i>caballejo</i>, or little pony, at a
<i>posada</i>, he proceeded to the <i>alcalde</i> for the purpose
of asking permission to sell the books, which that dignitary
immediately granted.&nbsp; He now entered a house and sold a
copy, and likewise a second.&nbsp; Emboldened by success, he
entered a third, which, it appeared, belonged to the
barber-surgeon of the village.&nbsp; This personage, having just
completed his dinner, was <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>seated in an armchair within his
doorway, when Victoriano made his appearance.&nbsp; He was a man
about thirty-five, of a savage truculent countenance.&nbsp; On
Victoriano&rsquo;s offering him a Testament, he took it in his
hand to examine it; but no sooner did his eyes glance over the
title-page than he burst out into a loud laugh, exclaiming,
&ldquo;<i>Ha</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>Don Jorge Borrow</i>, the English
heretic, we have encountered you at last.&nbsp; Glory to the
Virgin and the Saints!&nbsp; We have long been expecting you
here, and at length you are arrived.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
inquired the price of the book, and on being told three
<i>reals</i>, he flung down two, and rushed out of the house with
the Testament in his hand.</p>
<p>Victoriano now became alarmed, and determined upon leaving the
place as soon as possible.&nbsp; He therefore hurried back to the
<i>posada</i>, and having paid for the barley which his pony had
consumed, went into the stable, and placing the packsaddle on the
animal&rsquo;s back, was about to lead it forth, when the
<i>alcalde</i> of the village, the surgeon, and twelve other men,
some of whom were armed with muskets, suddenly presented
themselves.&nbsp; They instantly made Victoriano prisoner; and,
after seizing the books and laying an embargo on the pony,
proceeded, amidst much abuse, to drag the captive to what they
denominated their prison, a low damp apartment with a little
grated window, where they locked him up and left him.&nbsp; At
the expiration of three-quarters of an hour they again appeared,
and conducted him to the house of the curate, where they sat down
in conclave; the curate, who was a man stone blind, presiding,
whilst the sacristan officiated as secretary.&nbsp; The surgeon
having stated his accusation against the prisoner&mdash;namely,
that he had detected him in the act of selling a version of the
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>Scriptures in the vulgar tongue&mdash;the curate
proceeded to examine Victoriano, asking him his name and place of
residence; to which he replied that his name was Victoriano
Lopez, and that he was a native of Villa Seca, in the Sagra of
Toledo.&nbsp; The curate then demanded what religion he
professed? and whether he was a Mahometan or freemason? and
received for answer that he was a Roman Catholic.&nbsp; I must
here state that Victoriano, though sufficiently shrewd in his
way, was a poor old labourer of sixty-four; and until that moment
had never heard either of Mahometans or freemasons.&nbsp; The
curate becoming now incensed, called him a <i>tunante</i>, or
scoundrel, and added, &ldquo;You have sold your soul to a
heretic; we have long been aware of your proceedings, and those
of your master.&nbsp; You are the same Lopez whom he last year
rescued from the prison of Villallos, in the province of Avila; I
sincerely hope that he will attempt to do the same thing
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; shouted the rest of
the conclave, &ldquo;let him but venture here, and we will shed
his heart&rsquo;s blood on our stones.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this
manner they went on for nearly half an hour.&nbsp; At last they
broke up the meeting, and conducted Victoriano once more to his
prison.</p>
<p>During his confinement he lived tolerably well, being in
possession of money.&nbsp; His meals were sent him twice a day
from the <i>posada</i>, where his pony remained in embargo.&nbsp;
Once or twice he asked permission of the <i>alcalde</i>, who
visited him every night and morning with his armed guard, to
purchase pen and paper, in order that he might write to Madrid;
but this favour was peremptorily refused him, and all the
inhabitants of the village were forbidden under terrible
penalties to afford him the means of writing, or to convey any <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>message
from him beyond the precincts of the place, and two boys were
stationed before the window of his cell for the purpose of
watching everything which might be conveyed to him.</p>
<p>It happened one day that Victoriano, being in need of a
pillow, sent word to the people of the <i>posada</i> to send him
his <i>alforjas</i>, or saddle-bags, which they did.&nbsp; In
these bags there chanced to be a kind of rope, or, as it is
called in Spanish, <i>soga</i>, with which he was in the habit of
fastening his satchel to the pony&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The urchins
seeing an end of this rope, hanging from the <i>alforjas</i>,
instantly ran to the <i>alcalde</i> to give him
information.&nbsp; Late at evening, the <i>alcalde</i> again
visited the prisoner at the head of his twelve men as
usual.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Buenos noches</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation228a"></a><a href="#footnote228a"
class="citation">[228a]</a> said the <i>alcalde</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Buenas noches tenga usted</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation228b"></a><a href="#footnote228b"
class="citation">[228b]</a> replied Victoriano.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
what purpose did you send for the <i>soga</i> this
afternoon?&rdquo; demanded the functionary.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sent
for no <i>soga</i>,&rdquo; said the prisoner; &ldquo;I sent for
my <i>alforjas</i> to serve as a pillow, and it was sent in them
by chance.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a false, malicious
knave,&rdquo; retorted the <i>alcalde</i>; &ldquo;you intend to
hang yourself, and by so doing ruin us all, as your death would
be laid at our door.&nbsp; Give me the <i>soga</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
No greater insult can be offered to a Spaniard than to tax him
with an intention of committing suicide.&nbsp; Poor Victoriano
flew into a violent rage; and, after calling the <i>alcalde</i>
several very uncivil names, he pulled the <i>soga</i> from his
bags, flung it at his head, and told him to take it home and use
it for his own neck.</p>
<p>At length the people of the <i>posada</i> took pity on the
prisoner, perceiving that he was very harshly treated for no
crime at all; they therefore determined to afford him an
opportunity of informing his friends <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>of his situation, and accordingly
sent him a pen and inkhorn, concealed in a loaf of bread, and a
piece of writing-paper, pretending that the latter was intended
for cigars.&nbsp; So Victoriano wrote the letter: but now ensued
the difficulty of sending it to its destination, as no person in
the village dare have carried it for any reward.&nbsp; The good
people, however, persuaded a disbanded soldier from another
village, who chanced to be at Fuente la Higuera in quest of work,
to charge himself with it, assuring him that I would pay him well
for his trouble.&nbsp; The man, watching his opportunity,
received the letter from Victoriano at the window: and it was he
who, after travelling on foot all night, delivered it to me in
safety at Madrid.</p>
<p>I was now relieved from my anxiety, and had no fears for the
result.&nbsp; I instantly went to a friend who is in possession
of large estates about Guadalajara, in which province Fuenta la
Higuera is situated, who furnished me with letters to the civil
governor of Guadalajara and all the principal authorities; these
I delivered to Antonio, whom, at his own request, I despatched on
the errand of the prisoner&rsquo;s liberation.&nbsp; He first
directed his course to Fuente la Higuera, where, entering the
<i>alcalde&rsquo;s</i> house, he boldly told him what he had come
about.&nbsp; The <i>alcalde</i>, expecting that I was at hand,
with an army of Englishmen, for the purpose of rescuing the
prisoner, became greatly alarmed, and instantly despatched his
wife to summon his twelve men: however, on Antonio&rsquo;s
assuring him that there was no intention of having recourse to
violence, he became more tranquil.&nbsp; In a short time Antonio
was summoned before the conclave and its blind sacerdotal
president.&nbsp; They at first attempted to frighten him by
assuming a loud bullying tone, and talking of the necessity of <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>killing all
strangers, and especially the detested <i>Don Jorge</i> and his
dependents.&nbsp; Antonio, however, who was not a person apt to
allow himself to be easily terrified, scoffed at their threats,
and, showing them his letters to the authorities of Guadalajara,
said that he should proceed there on the morrow and denounce
their lawless conduct; adding that he was a Turkish subject, and
that should they dare to offer him the slightest incivility, he
would write to the Sublime Porte, in comparison with whom the
best kings in the world were but worms, and who would not fail to
avenge the wrongs of any of his children, however distant, in a
manner too terrible to be mentioned.&nbsp; He then returned to
his <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; The conclave now proceeded to deliberate
amongst themselves, and at last determined to send their prisoner
on the morrow to Guadalajara, and deliver him into the hands of
the civil governor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to keep up a semblance of authority,
they that night placed two men armed at the door of the
<i>posada</i> where Antonio was lodged, as if he himself was a
prisoner.&nbsp; These men, as often as the clock struck the hour,
shouted, &ldquo;<i>Ave Maria</i>!&nbsp; Death to the
heretics!&rdquo;&nbsp; Early in the morning the <i>alcalde</i>
presented himself at the <i>posada</i>; but before entering he
made an oration at the door to the people in the street, saying,
amongst other things, &ldquo;Brethren, these are the fellows who
have come to rob us of our religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then went in
to Antonio&rsquo;s apartment, and after saluting him with great
politeness, said, that as a royal or high Mass was about to be
celebrated that morning, he had come to invite him to go to
church with him.&nbsp; Whereupon Antonio, though by no means a
Mass-goer, rose and accompanied him, and <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>remained
two hours, as he told me, on his knees on the cold stones, to his
great discomfort; the eyes of the whole congregation being fixed
upon him during the time.</p>
<p>After Mass and breakfast, he departed for Guadalajara,
Victoriano having been already despatched under a guard.&nbsp; On
his arrival, he presented his letters to the individuals for whom
they were intended.&nbsp; The civil governor was convulsed with
merriment on hearing Antonio&rsquo;s account of the
adventure.&nbsp; Victoriano was set at liberty, and the books
were placed in embargo at Guadalajara; the governor stating,
however, that though it was his duty to detain them at present,
they should be sent to me whenever I chose to claim them: he,
moreover, said that he would do his best to cause the authorities
of Fuente la Higuera to be severely punished, as in the whole
affair they had acted in the most cruel, tyrannical manner, for
which they had no authority.&nbsp; Thus terminated this affair:
one of those little accidents which chequer missionary life in
Spain.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Termination of our Rural Labours&mdash;Alarm
of the Clergy&mdash;A New Experiment&mdash;Success at
Madrid&mdash;Goblin-Alguazil&mdash;Staff of Office&mdash;The
Corregidor&mdash;An Explanation&mdash;The Pope in
England&mdash;New Testament expounded&mdash;Works of Luther.</p>
<p>We proceeded in our task of distributing the Scriptures with
various success, until the middle of March, when I determined
upon starting for Talavera, for the purpose of seeing what it was
possible to accomplish in that town and the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
I accordingly bent my course in that direction, accompanied by
Antonio and Victoriano.&nbsp; On our way thither we stopped at
Naval Carnero, a large village five leagues to the west of
Madrid, where I remained three days, sending forth Victoriano to
the circumjacent hamlets with small cargoes of Testaments.&nbsp;
Providence, however, which had hitherto so remarkably favoured us
in these rural excursions, now withdrew from us its support, and
brought them to a sudden termination: for in whatever place the
sacred writings were offered for sale, they were forthwith seized
by persons who appeared to be upon the watch; which events
compelled me to alter my intention of proceeding to Talavera, and
to return forthwith to Madrid.</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>I
subsequently learned that our proceedings on the other side of
Madrid having caused alarm amongst the heads of the clergy, they
had made a formal complaint to the government, who immediately
sent orders to all the <i>alcaldes</i> of the villages, great and
small, in New Castile, to seize the New Testament wherever it
might be exposed for sale; but, at the same time, enjoining them
to be particularly careful not to detain or maltreat the person
or persons who might be attempting to vend it.&nbsp; An exact
description of myself accompanied these orders; and the
authorities, both civil and military, were exhorted to be on
their guard against me and my arts and machinations; for, as the
document stated, I was to-day in one place, and tomorrow at
twenty leagues&rsquo; distance.</p>
<p>I was not much discouraged by this blow, which, indeed, did
not come entirely unexpected.&nbsp; I, however, determined to
change the sphere of action, and not expose the sacred volume to
seizure at every step which I should take to circulate it.&nbsp;
In my late attempts I had directed my attention exclusively to
the villages and small towns, in which it was quite easy for the
government to frustrate my efforts by means of circulars to the
local authorities, who would, of course, be on the alert, and
whose vigilance it would be impossible to baffle, as every
novelty which occurs in a small place is forthwith bruited
about.&nbsp; But the case would be widely different amongst the
crowds of the capital, where I could pursue my labours with
comparative secrecy.&nbsp; My present plan was to abandon the
rural districts, and to offer the sacred volume at Madrid, from
house to house, at the same low price as in the country.&nbsp;
This plan I forthwith put into execution.</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>Having an extensive acquaintance amongst the lower
orders, I selected eight intelligent individuals to co-operate
with me, amongst whom were five women.&nbsp; All these I supplied
with Testaments, and then sent them forth to all the parishes in
Madrid.&nbsp; The result of their efforts more than answered my
expectations.&nbsp; In less than fifteen days after my return
from Naval Carnero, nearly six hundred copies of the life and
words of Him of Nazareth had been sold in the streets and alleys
of Madrid: a fact which I hope I may be permitted to mention with
gladness and with decent triumph in the Lord.</p>
<p>One of the richest streets is the Calle Montera, where reside
the principal merchants and shopkeepers of Madrid.&nbsp; It is,
in fact, the street of commerce, in which respect, and in being a
favourite promenade, it corresponds with the far-famed Nefsky <a
name="citation234"></a><a href="#footnote234"
class="citation">[234]</a> of Saint Petersburg.&nbsp; Every house
in this street was supplied with its Testament, and the same
might be said with respect to the Puerta del Sol.&nbsp; Nay, in
some instances, every individual in the house, man and child,
manservant and maid-servant, was furnished with a copy.&nbsp; My
Greek, Antonio, made wonderful exertions in this quarter; and it
is but justice to say that, but for his instrumentality, on many
occasions, I might have been by no means able to give so
favourable an account of the spread of &ldquo;the Bible in
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a time when I was in the habit of
saying &ldquo;dark Madrid,&rdquo; an expression which, I thank
God, I could now drop.&nbsp; It were scarcely just to call a city
&ldquo;dark,&rdquo; in which thirteen hundred Testaments at least
were in circulation, and in daily use.</p>
<p>It was now that I turned to account a supply of <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Bibles
which I had received from Barcelona, in sheets, at the
commencement of the preceding year.&nbsp; The demand for the
entire Scriptures was great; indeed far greater than I could
answer, as the books were disposed of faster than they could be
bound by the man whom I employed for that purpose.&nbsp;
Eight-and-twenty copies were bespoken and paid for before
delivery.&nbsp; Many of these Bibles found their way into the
best houses in Madrid.&nbsp; The Marquis of --- had a large
family, but every individual of it, old and young, was in
possession of a Bible, and likewise a Testament, which, strange
to say, were recommended by the chaplain of the house.&nbsp; One
of my most zealous agents in the propagation of the Bible was an
ecclesiastic.&nbsp; He never walked out without carrying one
beneath his gown, which he offered to the first person he met
whom he thought likely to purchase.&nbsp; Another excellent
assistant was an elderly gentleman of Navarre, enormously rich,
who was continually purchasing copies on his own account, which
he, as I was told, sent into his native province, for
distribution amongst his friends and the poor.</p>
<p>On a certain night I had retired to rest rather more early
than usual, being slightly indisposed.&nbsp; I soon fell asleep,
and had continued so for some hours, when I was suddenly aroused
by the opening of the door of the small apartment in which I
lay.&nbsp; I started up, and beheld Maria Diaz, with a lamp in
her hand, enter the room.&nbsp; I observed that her features,
which were in general peculiarly calm and placid, wore a somewhat
startled expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the hour, and what
brings you here?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; said she, closing the door,
and coming up to the bedside, &ldquo;it is close upon midnight;
but a <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>messenger belonging to the police has just entered the
house, and demanded to see you.&nbsp; I told him that it was
impossible, for that your worship was in bed.&nbsp; Whereupon he
sneezed in my face, and said that he would see you if you were in
your coffin.&nbsp; He has all the look of a goblin, and has
thrown me into a tremor.&nbsp; I am far from being a timid
person, as you are aware, <i>Don Jorge</i>; but I confess that I
never cast my eyes on these wretches of the police, but my heart
dies away within me!&nbsp; I know them but too well, and what
they are capable of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;be under no apprehension;
let him come in, I fear him not, whether he be <i>alguazil</i> or
hobgoblin. <a name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; Stand, however, at the doorway,
that you may be a witness of what takes place, as it is more than
probable that he comes at this unseasonable hour to create a
disturbance, that he may have an opportunity of making an
unfavourable report to his principals, like the fellow on the
former occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hostess left the apartment, and I heard her say a word or
two to some one in the passage, whereupon there was a loud
sneeze, and in a moment after a singular figure appeared at the
doorway.&nbsp; It was that of a very old man, with long white
hair, which escaped from beneath the eaves of an exceedingly
high-peaked hat.&nbsp; He stooped considerably, and moved along
with a shambling gait.&nbsp; I could not see much of his face,
which, as the landlady stood behind him with the lamp, was
consequently in deep shadow.&nbsp; I could observe, however, that
his eyes sparkled like those of a ferret.&nbsp; He advanced to
the foot of the bed, in which I was <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>still lying, wondering what this
strange visit could mean; and there he stood gazing at me for a
minute, at least, without uttering a syllable.&nbsp; Suddenly,
however, he protruded a spare skinny hand from the cloak in which
it had hitherto been enveloped, and pointed with a short staff,
tipped with metal, in the direction of my face, as if he were
commencing an exorcism.&nbsp; He appeared to be about to speak,
but his words, if he intended any, were stifled in their birth by
a sudden sternutation which escaped him, and which was so violent
that the hostess started back, exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Ave Maria
pur&iacute;sima</i>!&rdquo; and nearly dropped the lamp in her
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good person,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what do you mean
by this foolish hobgoblinry?&nbsp; If you have anything to
communicate do so at once, and go about your business.&nbsp; I am
unwell, and you are depriving me of my repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the virtue of this staff,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;and the authority which it gives me to do and say that
which is convenient, I do command, order, and summon you to
appear to-morrow, at the eleventh hour, at the office of my lord
the <i>corregidor</i> of this village of Madrid, <a
name="citation237"></a><a href="#footnote237"
class="citation">[237]</a> in order that, standing before him
humbly, and with befitting reverence, you may listen to whatever
he may have to say, or, if necessary, may yield yourself up to
receive the castigation of any crimes which you may have
committed, whether trivial or enormous.&nbsp; <i>Tenez</i>,
<i>comp&egrave;re</i>,&rdquo; he added, in most villanous French,
&ldquo;<i>voil&agrave; mon affaire</i>; <i>voil&agrave; ce que je
viens vous dire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he glared at me for a moment, nodded his head twice,
and replacing his staff beneath his <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>cloak, shambled out of the room, and
with a valedictory sneeze in the passage left the house.</p>
<p>Precisely at eleven on the following day I attended at the
office of the <i>corregidor</i>.&nbsp; He was not the individual
whose anger I had incurred on a former occasion, and who had
thought proper to imprison me, but another person, I believe a
Catalan, whose name I have also forgotten.&nbsp; Indeed, these
civil employments were at this period given to-day and taken away
tomorrow, so that the person who held one of them for a month
might consider himself a functionary of long standing.&nbsp; I
was not kept waiting a moment, but as soon as I had announced
myself, was forthwith ushered into the presence of the
<i>corregidor</i>&mdash;a good-looking, portly, and well-dressed
personage, seemingly about fifty.&nbsp; He was writing at a desk
when I entered, but almost immediately arose and came towards
me.&nbsp; He looked me full in the face, and I, nothing abashed,
kept my eyes fixed upon his.&nbsp; He had, perhaps, expected a
less independent bearing, and that I should have quaked and
crouched before him; but now, conceiving himself bearded in his
own den, his old Spanish leaven was forthwith stirred up.&nbsp;
He plucked his whiskers fiercely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Escuchad</i>,&rdquo; said he, casting upon me a
ferocious glance, &ldquo;I wish to ask you a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I answer any question of your excellency,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I shall take the liberty of putting one
myself.&nbsp; What law or reason is there that I, a peaceable
individual and a foreigner, should have my rest disturbed by
<i>duendes</i> and hobgoblins sent at midnight to summon me to
appear at public offices like a criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not speak the truth,&rdquo; shouted the
<i>corregidor</i>; &ldquo;the person sent to summon you was
neither <i>duende</i> nor hobgoblin, but one of the most ancient
<a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>and
respectable officers of this <i>casa</i>, and so far from being
despatched at midnight, it wanted twenty-five minutes to that
hour by my own watch when he left this office, and as your
lodging is not distant, he must have arrived there at least ten
minutes before midnight, so that you are by no means accurate,
and are found wanting in regard to truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A distinction without a difference,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my own part, if I am to be disturbed in
my sleep, it is of little consequence whether at midnight or ten
minutes before that time; and with respect to your messenger,
although he might not be a hobgoblin, he had all the appearance
of one, and assuredly answered the purpose, by frightening the
woman of the house almost into fits by his hideous grimaces and
sneezing convulsions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Corregidor</i>.&mdash;You are a&mdash;I know not
what.&nbsp; Do you know that I have the power to imprison
you?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;You have twenty <i>alguazils</i> at your
beck and call, and have of course the power, and so had your
predecessor, who nearly lost his situation by imprisoning me; but
you know full well that you have not the right, as I am not under
your jurisdiction, but that of the captain-general.&nbsp; If I
have obeyed your summons, it was simply because I had a curiosity
to know what you wanted with me, and from no other motive
whatever.&nbsp; As for imprisoning me, I beg leave to assure you,
that you have my full consent to do so; the most polite society
in Madrid is to be found in the prison, and as I am at present
compiling a vocabulary of the language of the Madrilenian
thieves, I should have, in being imprisoned, an excellent
opportunity of completing it.&nbsp; There is much to be <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>learnt even
in the prison, for, as the gypsies say, &ldquo;The dog that trots
about finds a bone.&rdquo; <a name="citation240"></a><a
href="#footnote240" class="citation">[240]</a></p>
<p><i>Corregidor</i>.&mdash;Your words are not those of a
<i>caballero</i>.&nbsp; Do you forget where you are, and in whose
presence?&nbsp; Is this a fitting place to talk of thieves and
gypsies in?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Really I know of no place more fitting,
unless it be the prison.&nbsp; But we are wasting time, and I am
anxious to know for what I have been summoned; whether for crimes
trivial or enormous, as the messenger said.</p>
<p>It was a long time before I could obtain the required
information from the incensed <i>corregidor</i>; at last,
however, it came.&nbsp; It appeared that a box of Testaments,
which I had despatched to Naval Carnero, had been seized by the
local authorities, and having been detained there for some time,
was at last sent back to Madrid, intended, as it now appeared,
for the hands of the <i>corregidor</i>.&nbsp; One day as it was
lying at the waggon-office, Antonio chanced to enter on some
business of his own and recognized the box, which he instantly
claimed as my property, and having paid the carriage, removed it
to my warehouse.&nbsp; He had considered the matter as of so
little importance, that he had not as yet mentioned it to
me.&nbsp; The poor <i>corregidor</i>, however, had no doubt that
it was a deep-laid scheme to plunder and insult him.&nbsp; And
now, working himself up into almost a frenzy of excitement, he
stamped on the ground, exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Que
picardia</i>!&nbsp; <i>Que infamia</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old system, thought I, of prejudging people, and imputing
to them motives and actions of which they never dreamed.&nbsp; I
then told him frankly that I was <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>entirely ignorant of the
circumstance by which he had felt himself aggrieved; but that if,
upon inquiry, I found that the chest had actually been removed by
my servant from the office to which it had been forwarded, I
would cause it forthwith to be restored, although it was my own
property.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have plenty more Testaments,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and can afford to lose fifty or a hundred.&nbsp; I am a
man of peace, and wish not to have any dispute with the
authorities for the sake of an old chest and a cargo of books,
whose united value would scarcely amount to forty
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me for a moment, as if in doubt of my sincerity,
then, again plucking his whiskers, he forthwith proceeded to
attack me in another quarter: &ldquo;<i>Pero que infamia</i>,
<i>que picardia</i>! to come into Spain for the purpose of
overturning the religion of the country.&nbsp; What would you say
if the Spaniards were to go to England and attempt to overturn
the Lutheranism established there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would be most heartily welcome,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;more especially if they would attempt to do so by
circulating the Bible, the book of Christians, even as the
English are doing in Spain.&nbsp; But your excellency is not
perhaps aware that the Pope has a fair field and fair play in
England, and is permitted to make as many converts from
Lutheranism every day in the week as are disposed to go over to
him.&nbsp; He cannot boast, however, of much success; the people
are too fond of light to embrace darkness, and would smile at the
idea of exchanging their Gospel privileges for the superstitious
ceremonies and observances of the Church of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my repeating my promise that the books and chest should be
forthwith restored, the <i>corregidor</i> <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>declared
himself satisfied, and all of a sudden became excessively polite
and condescending: he even went so far as to say that he left it
entirely with myself, whether to return the books or not;
&ldquo;and,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;before you go, I wish to
tell you that my private opinion is, that it is highly advisable
in all countries to allow full and perfect tolerance in religious
matters, and to permit every religious system to stand or fall
according to its own merits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the concluding words of the <i>corregidor</i> of
Madrid, which, whether they expressed his private opinion or not,
were certainly grounded on sense and reason.&nbsp; I saluted him
respectfully and retired, and forthwith performed my promise with
regard to the books; and thus terminated this affair.</p>
<p>It almost appeared to me at this time that a religious reform
was commencing in Spain; indeed, matters had of late come to my
knowledge, which, had they been prophesied only a year before, I
should have experienced much difficulty in believing.</p>
<p>The reader will be surprised when I state that, in two
churches of Madrid, the New Testament was regularly expounded
every Sunday evening, by the respective curates, to about twenty
children who attended, and who were all provided with copies of
the society&rsquo;s edition of Madrid, 1837. <a
name="citation242a"></a><a href="#footnote242a"
class="citation">[242a]</a>&nbsp; The churches which I allude to
were those of San Gines and Santa Cruz. <a
name="citation242b"></a><a href="#footnote242b"
class="citation">[242b]</a>&nbsp; Now, I humbly conceive that
this fact alone is more than equivalent to all the expense which
the <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>society had incurred in the efforts which it had been
making to introduce the Gospel into Spain; but be this as it may,
I am certain that it amply recompensed me for all the anxiety and
unhappiness which I had undergone.&nbsp; I now felt that whenever
I should be compelled to discontinue my labours in the Peninsula,
I should retire without the slightest murmur, my heart being
filled with gratitude to the Lord for having permitted me,
useless vessel as I was, to see at least some of the seed
springing up, which during two years I had been casting on the
stony ground of the interior of Spain.</p>
<p>When I recollected the difficulties which had encompassed our
path, I could sometimes hardly credit all that the Almighty had
permitted us to accomplish within the last year.&nbsp; A large
edition of the New Testament had been almost entirely disposed of
in the very centre of Spain, in spite of the opposition and the
furious cry of the sanguinary priesthood and the edicts of a
deceitful government, and a spirit of religious inquiry excited,
which I had fervent hope would sooner or later lead to blessed
and most important results.&nbsp; Till of late the name most
abhorred and dreaded in these parts of Spain was that of Martin
Luther, who was in general considered as a species of demon, a
cousin-german to Belial and Beelzebub, who, under the disguise of
a man, wrote and preached blasphemy against the Highest; yet now,
strange to say, this once abominated personage was spoken of with
no slight degree of respect.&nbsp; People with Bibles in their
hands not unfrequently visited me, inquiring with much
earnestness, and with no slight degree of simplicity, for the
writings of the great Doctor Martin, whom, indeed, some supposed
to be still alive.</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>It
will be as well here to observe, that of all the names connected
with the Reformation, that of Luther is the only one known in
Spain; and let me add, that no controversial writings but his are
likely to be esteemed as possessing the slightest weight or
authority, however great their intrinsic merit may be.&nbsp; The
common description of tracts, written with the view of exposing
the errors of Popery, are therefore not calculated to prove of
much benefit in Spain, though it is probable that much good might
be accomplished by well executed translations of judicious
selections from the works of Luther.</p>

Seville&mdash;Orange Trees and Flowers&mdash;Murillo&mdash;The
Guardian Angel&mdash;Dionysius&mdash;My Coadjutors&mdash;Demand
for the Bible.</p>
<p>By the middle of April I had sold as many Testaments as I
thought Madrid would bear: I therefore called in my people, for I
was afraid to overstock the market, and to bring the book into
contempt by making it too common.&nbsp; I had, indeed, by this
time, barely a thousand copies remaining of the edition which I
had printed two years previously; and with respect to Bibles,
every copy was by this time disposed of, though there was still a
great demand for them, which, of course, I was unable to
satisfy.</p>
<p>With the remaining copies of the Testament, I now determined
to betake myself to Seville, where little had hitherto been
effected in the way of circulation: my preparations were soon
made.&nbsp; The roads were at this time in a highly dangerous
state, on which account I thought to go along with a convoy,
which was about to start for Andalusia.&nbsp; Two days, however,
before its departure, understanding that the number of people who
likewise proposed to avail themselves of it was likely to be very
great, and reflecting on the <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>slowness of this way of travelling,
and moreover the insults to which civilians were frequently
subjected from the soldiers and petty officers, I determined to
risk the journey with the mail.&nbsp; This resolution I carried
into effect.&nbsp; Antonio, whom I had resolved to take with me,
and my two horses, departed with the convoy, whilst in a few days
I followed with the mail courier.&nbsp; We travelled all the way
without the slightest accident, my usual wonderful good fortune
accompanying us.&nbsp; I might well call it wonderful, for I was
running into the den of a lion; the whole of La Mancha, with the
exception of a few fortified places, being once more in the hands
of Palillos and his banditti, who, whenever it pleased them,
stopped the courier, burnt the vehicle and letters, murdered the
paltry escort, and carried away any chance passenger to the
mountains, where an enormous ransom was demanded, the alternative
being four shots through the head, as the Spaniards say.</p>
<p>The upper part of Andalusia was becoming rapidly nearly as bad
as La Mancha.&nbsp; The last time the mail had passed, it was
attacked at the defile of La Rumblar <a name="citation246"></a><a
href="#footnote246" class="citation">[246]</a> by six mounted
robbers; it was guarded by an escort of as many soldiers, but the
former suddenly galloped from behind a solitary <i>venta</i>, and
dashed the soldiers to the ground, who were taken quite by
surprise, the hoofs of the robbers&rsquo; horses making no noise
on account of the sandy nature of the ground.&nbsp; The <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>soldiers
were instantly disarmed and bound to olive trees, with the
exception of two, who escaped amongst the rocks; they were then
mocked and tormented by the robbers, or rather fiends, for nearly
half an hour, when they were shot; the head of the corporal who
commanded being blown to fragments with a blunderbuss.&nbsp; The
robbers then burned the coach, which they accomplished by
igniting the letters by means of the tow with which they light
their cigars.&nbsp; The life of the courier was saved by one of
them, who had formerly been his postilion; he was, however,
robbed and stripped.&nbsp; As we passed by the scene of the
butchery, the poor fellow wept, and, though a Spaniard, cursed
Spain and the Spaniards, saying that he intended shortly to pass
over to the Moreria, to confess Mahomet, and to learn the law of
the Moors, for that any country and religion were better than his
own.&nbsp; He pointed to the tree where the corporal had been
tied; though much rain had fallen since, the ground around was
still saturated with blood, and a dog was gnawing a piece of the
unfortunate wretch&rsquo;s skull.&nbsp; A friar travelled with us
the whole way from Madrid to Seville; he was of the missionaries,
and was going to the Philippine Islands, to conquer (<i>para
conquistar</i>), for such was his word, by which I suppose he
meant preaching to the Indians.&nbsp; During the whole journey he
exhibited every symptom of the most abject fear, which operated
upon him so that he became deadly sick, and we were obliged to
stop twice in the road, and lay him amongst the green corn.&nbsp;
He said that if he fell into the hands of the factious, he was a
lost priest, for that they would first make him say Mass, and
then blow him up with gunpowder.&nbsp; He had been professor of
philosophy, as he told me, in one of <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>the convents (I think it was San
Tomas) of Madrid before their suppression, but appeared to be
grossly ignorant of the Scriptures, which he confounded with the
works of Virgil.</p>
<p>We stopped at Manzanares as usual; it was Sunday morning, and
the market-place was crowded with people.&nbsp; I was recognized
in a moment, and twenty pair of legs instantly hurried away in
quest of the prophetess, who presently made her appearance in the
house to which we had retired to breakfast.&nbsp; After many
greetings on both sides, she proceeded, in her Latin, to give me
an account of all that had occurred in the village since I had
last been there, and of the atrocities of the factious in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I asked her to breakfast, and introduced her
to the friar, whom she addressed in this manner: &ldquo;<i>Anne
Domine Reverendissime facis adhuc sacrificium</i>?&rdquo; <a
name="citation248"></a><a href="#footnote248"
class="citation">[248]</a>&nbsp; But the friar did not understand
her, and, waxing angry, anathematized her for a witch, and bade
her begone.&nbsp; She was, however, not to be disconcerted, and
commenced singing, in extemporary Castilian verse, the praises of
friars and religious houses in general.&nbsp; On departing I gave
her a <i>peseta</i>, upon which she burst into tears, and
entreated that I would write to her if I reached Seville in
safety.</p>
<p>We did arrive at Seville in safety, and I took leave of the
friar, telling him that I hoped to meet him again at
Philippi.&nbsp; As it was my intention to remain at Seville for
some months, I determined to hire a house, in which I conceived I
could live with <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>more privacy, and at the same time more economically,
than in a <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; It was not long before I found one
in every respect suited to me.&nbsp; It was situated in the
Plazuela de la Pila Seca, a retired part of the city in the
neighbourhood of the cathedral, and at a short distance from the
gate of Xeres; and in this house, on the arrival of Antonio and
the horses, which occurred within a few days, I took up my
abode.</p>
<p>I was now once more in beautiful Seville, and had soon ample
time and leisure to enjoy its delights and those of the
surrounding country.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at the time of my
arrival, and indeed for the next ensuing fortnight, the heaven of
Andalusia, in general so glorious, was overcast with black
clouds, which discharged tremendous showers of rain, such as few
of the Sevillians, according to their own account, had ever seen
before.&nbsp; This extraordinary weather had wrought no little
damage in the neighbourhood, causing the Guadalquivir, which,
during the rainy season, is a rapid and furious stream, to
overflow its banks, and to threaten an inundation.&nbsp; It is
true that intervals were occurring when the sun made his
appearance from his cloudy tabernacle, and with his golden rays
caused everything around to smile, enticing the butterfly forth
from the bush, and the lizard from the hollow tree, and I
invariably availed myself of these intervals to take a hasty
promenade.</p>
<p>Oh how pleasant it is, especially in springtide, to stray
along the shores of the Guadalquivir!&nbsp; Not far from the
city, down the river, lies a grove called <i>Las Delicias</i>, or
&ldquo;The Delights.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consists of trees of various
kinds, but more especially of poplars and <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>elms, and
is traversed by long shady walks.&nbsp; This grove is the
favourite promenade of the Sevillians, and there one occasionally
sees assembled whatever the town produces of beauty or
gallantry.&nbsp; There wander the black-eyed Andalusian dames and
damsels, clad in their graceful silken <i>mantillas</i>; and
there gallops the Andalusian cavalier, on his long-tailed
thick-maned steed of Moorish ancestry.&nbsp; As the sun is
descending, it is enchanting to glance back from this place in
the direction of the city; the prospect is inexpressibly
beautiful.&nbsp; Yonder in the distance, high and enormous,
stands the Golden Tower, now used as a toll-house, but the
principal bulwark of the city in the time of the Moors.&nbsp; It
stands on the shore of the river, like a giant keeping watch, and
is the first edifice which attracts the eye of the voyager as he
moves up the stream to Seville.&nbsp; On the other side, opposite
the tower, stands the noble Augustine convent, the ornament of
the <i>faubourg</i> of Triana, whilst between the two edifices
rolls the broad Guadalquivir, bearing on its bosom a flotilla of
barks from Catalonia and Valencia.&nbsp; Further up is seen the
bridge of boats, which traverses the water.&nbsp; The principal
object of this prospect, however, is the Golden Tower, where the
beams of the setting sun seem to be concentrated as in a focus,
so that it appears built of pure gold, and probably from that
circumstance received the name which it now bears.&nbsp; Cold,
cold must the heart be which can remain insensible to the
beauties of this magic scene, to do justice to which the pencil
of Claude himself were barely equal.&nbsp; Often have I shed
tears of rapture whilst I beheld it, and listened to the thrush
and the nightingale piping forth their melodious songs in <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>the woods,
and inhaled the breeze laden with the perfume of the thousand
orange gardens of Seville:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Kennst du das Land wo die Citronen
bl&uuml;hen?&rdquo; <a name="citation251a"></a><a
href="#footnote251a" class="citation">[251a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interior of Seville scarcely corresponds with the
exterior; the streets are narrow, badly paved, and full of misery
and beggary.&nbsp; The houses are, for the most part, built in
the Moorish fashion, with a quadrangular <i>patio</i>, or court,
in the centre, where stands a marble fountain, constantly
distilling limpid water.&nbsp; These courts, during the time of
the summer heats, are covered over with a canvas awning, and
beneath this the family sit during the greater part of the
day.&nbsp; In many, especially those belonging to the houses of
the wealthy, are to be found shrubs, orange trees, and all kinds
of flowers, and perhaps a small aviary, so that no situation can
be conceived more delicious than to lie here in the shade,
hearkening to the song of the birds and the voice of the
fountain.</p>
<p>Nothing is more calculated to interest the stranger as he
wanders through Seville, than a view of these courts, obtained
from the street through the iron-grated door.&nbsp; Oft have I
stopped to observe them, and as often sighed that my fate did not
permit me to reside in such an Eden for the remainder of my
days.&nbsp; On a former occasion I have spoken of the cathedral
of Seville, but only in a brief and cursory manner. <a
name="citation251b"></a><a href="#footnote251b"
class="citation">[251b]</a>&nbsp; It is, perhaps, the most
magnificent cathedral in all Spain, and though not so regular in
its architecture as those of Toledo and Burgos, is far <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>more worthy
of admiration when considered as a whole.&nbsp; It is utterly
impossible to wander through the long aisles, and to raise
one&rsquo;s eyes to the richly inlaid roof, supported by colossal
pillars, without experiencing sensations of sacred awe and deep
astonishment.&nbsp; It is true that the interior, like those of
the generality of the Spanish cathedrals, is somewhat dark and
gloomy; yet it loses nothing by this gloom, which, on the
contrary, rather increases the solemnity of the effect.&nbsp;
Notre Dame of Paris is a noble building, yet to him who has seen
the Spanish cathedrals, and particularly this of Seville, it
almost appears trivial and mean, and more like a town-hall than a
temple of the Eternal.&nbsp; The Parisian cathedral is entirely
destitute of that solemn darkness and gloomy pomp which so abound
in the Sevillian, and is thus destitute of the principal
requisite to a cathedral.</p>
<p>In most of the chapels are to be found some of the very best
pictures of the Spanish school; and, in particular, many of the
master-pieces of Murillo, a native of Seville.&nbsp; Of all the
pictures of this extraordinary man, one of the least celebrated
is that which has always wrought on me the most profound
impression.&nbsp; I allude to the Guardian Angel, <i>El Angel de
la Guardia</i>, a small picture which stands at the bottom of the
church, and looks up the principal aisle.&nbsp; The angel,
holding a flaming sword in his right hand, is conducting the
child: this child is, in my opinion, the most wonderful of all
the creations of Murillo; the form is that of an infant about
five years of age, and the expression of the countenance is quite
infantine, but the tread&mdash;it is the tread of a conqueror, of
a God, of the Creator of the universe; and the earthly globe
appears to tremble beneath its majesty.</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>The
service of the cathedral is in general well attended, especially
when it is known that a sermon is to be preached.&nbsp; All these
sermons are extemporaneous; some of them are edifying, and
faithful to the Scriptures.&nbsp; I have often listened to them
with pleasure, though I was much surprised to remark, that when
the preachers quoted from the Bible, their quotations were almost
invariably taken from the apocryphal writings.&nbsp; There is in
general no lack of worshippers at the principal
shrines&mdash;women for the most part&mdash;many of whom appear
to be animated with the most fervent devotion.</p>
<p>I had flattered myself, previous to my departure from Madrid,
that I should experience but little difficulty in the circulation
of the Gospel in Andalusia, at least for a time, as the field was
new, and myself and the object of my mission less known and
dreaded than in New Castile.&nbsp; It appeared, however, that the
government at Madrid had fulfilled its threat, transmitting
orders throughout Spain for the seizure of my books wherever
found.&nbsp; The Testaments that arrived from Madrid were seized
at the custom-house, to which place all goods on their arrival,
even from the interior, are carried, in order that a duty be
imposed upon them.&nbsp; Through the management of Antonio,
however, I procured one of the two chests, whilst the other was
sent down to San Lucar, to be embarked for a foreign land as soon
as I could make arrangements for that purpose.</p>
<p>I did not permit myself to be discouraged by this slight
<i>contretemps</i>, although I heartily regretted the loss of the
books which had been seized, and which I could no longer hope to
circulate in these parts, where they were so much wanted; but I
consoled myself <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>with the reflection, that I had still several hundred
at my disposal, from the distribution of which, if it pleased the
Lord, a blessed harvest might still proceed.</p>
<p>I did not commence operations for some time, for I was in a
strange place, and scarcely knew what course to pursue.&nbsp; I
had no one to assist me but poor Antonio, who was as ignorant of
the place as myself.&nbsp; Providence, however, soon sent me a
coadjutor in rather a singular manner.&nbsp; I was standing in
the courtyard of the Reyna Posada, where I occasionally dined,
when a man, singularly dressed and gigantically tall,
entered.&nbsp; My curiosity was excited, and I inquired of the
master of the house who he was.&nbsp; He informed me that he was
a foreigner, who had resided a considerable time in Seville, and
he believed a Greek.&nbsp; Upon hearing this, I instantly went up
to the stranger, and accosted him in the Greek language, in
which, though I speak it very ill, I can make myself
understood.&nbsp; He replied in the same idiom, and, flattered by
the interest which I, a foreigner, expressed for his nation, was
not slow in communicating to me his history.&nbsp; He told me
that his name was Dionysius, that he was a native of Cephalonia,
and had been educated for the Church, which, not suiting his
temper, he had abandoned, in order to follow the profession of
the sea, for which he had an early inclination.&nbsp; That after
many adventures and changes of fortune, he found himself one
morning on the coast of Spain, a shipwrecked mariner, and that,
ashamed to return to his own country in poverty and distress, he
had remained in the Peninsula, residing chiefly in Seville, where
he now carried on a small trade in books.&nbsp; He said that he
was of the <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>Greek religion, to which he professed strong
attachment, and, soon discovering that I was a Protestant, spoke
with unbounded abhorrence of the papal system; nay, of its
followers in general, whom he called Latins, and whom he charged
with the ruin of his own country, inasmuch as they sold it to the
Turk.&nbsp; It instantly struck me, that this individual would be
an excellent assistant in the work which had brought me to
Seville, namely, the propagation of the eternal Gospel; and,
accordingly, after some more conversation, in which he exhibited
considerable learning, I explained myself to him.&nbsp; He
entered into my views with eagerness, and, in the sequel, I had
no reason to regret my confidence, he having disposed of a
considerable number of New Testaments, and even contrived to send
a certain number of copies to two small towns at some distance
from Seville.</p>
<p>Another helper in the circulation of the Gospel I found in an
aged professor of music, who, with much stiffness and
ceremoniousness, united much that was excellent and
admirable.&nbsp; This venerable individual, only three days after
I had made his acquaintance, brought me the price of six
Testaments and a Gypsy Gospel, which he had sold under the heat
of an Andalusian sun.&nbsp; What was his motive?&nbsp; A
Christian one truly.&nbsp; He said that his unfortunate
countrymen, who were then robbing and murdering each other, might
probably be rendered better by the reading of the Gospel, but
could never be injured.&nbsp; Adding, that many a man had been
reformed by the Scriptures, but that no one ever yet became a
thief or assassin from its perusal.</p>
<p>But my most extraordinary agent was one whom I occasionally
employed in circulating the Scriptures <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>amongst the
lower classes.&nbsp; I might have turned the services of this
individual to far greater account had the quantity of books at my
disposal been greater; but they were now diminishing rapidly, and
as I had no hopes of a fresh supply, I was almost tempted to be
niggard of the few which remained.&nbsp; This agent was a Greek
bricklayer, by name Johannes Chrysostom, who had been introduced
to me by Dionysius.&nbsp; He was a native of the Morea, but had
been upwards of thirty-five years in Spain, so that he had almost
entirely lost his native language.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his
attachment to his own country was so strong that he considered
whatever was not Greek as utterly barbarous and bad.&nbsp; Though
entirely destitute of education, he had, by his strength of
character and by a kind of rude eloquence which he possessed,
obtained such a mastery over the minds of the labouring classes
of Seville, that they assented to almost everything he said,
notwithstanding the shocks which their prejudices were
continually receiving.&nbsp; So that, although he was a
foreigner, he could at any time have become the Masaniello <a
name="citation256"></a><a href="#footnote256"
class="citation">[256]</a> of Seville.&nbsp; A more honest
creature I never saw, and I soon found that if I employed him,
notwithstanding his eccentricities, I might entertain perfect
confidence that his actions would be no disparagement to the book
he vended.</p>
<p>We were continually pressed for Bibles, which of course we
could not supply.&nbsp; Testaments were held in comparatively
little esteem.&nbsp; I had by this time made the discovery of a
fact which it would have <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>been well had I been aware of three
years before: but we live and learn.&nbsp; I mean the
inexpediency of printing Testaments, and Testaments <i>alone</i>,
for Catholic countries.&nbsp; The reason is plain: the Catholic,
unused to Scripture reading, finds a thousand things which he
cannot possibly understand in the New Testament, the foundation
of which is the Old.&nbsp; &ldquo;Search the Scriptures, for they
bear witness of me,&rdquo; may well be applied to this
point.&nbsp; It may be replied, that New Testaments separate are
in great demand and of infinite utility in England; but England,
thanks be to the Lord, is not a papal country; and though an
English labourer may read a Testament, and derive from it the
most blessed fruit, it does not follow that a Spanish or Italian
peasant will enjoy similar success, as he will find many dark
things with which the other is well acquainted, and competent to
understand, being versed in the Bible history from his
childhood.&nbsp; I confess, however, that in my summer campaign
of the preceding year, I could not have accomplished with Bibles
what Providence permitted me to effect with Testaments, the
former being far too bulky for rural journeys.</p>

Dehesa&mdash;Johannes Chrysostom&mdash;Manuel&mdash;Bookselling
at Seville&mdash;Dionysius and the Priests&mdash;Athens and
Rome&mdash;Proselytism&mdash;Seizure of
Testaments&mdash;Departure from Seville.</p>
<p>I have already stated that I had hired an empty house in
Seville, wherein I purposed to reside for some months.&nbsp; It
stood in a solitary situation, occupying one side of a small
square.&nbsp; It was built quite in the beautiful taste of
Andalusia, with a court paved with small slabs of white and blue
marble.&nbsp; In the middle of this court was a fountain well
supplied with the crystal lymph, the murmur of which, as it fell
from its slender pillar into an octangular basin, might be heard
in every apartment.&nbsp; The house itself was large and
spacious, consisting of two stories, and containing room
sufficient for at least ten times the number of inmates which now
occupied it.&nbsp; I generally kept during the day in the lower
apartments, on account of the refreshing coolness which pervaded
them.&nbsp; In one of these was an immense stone water-trough,
ever overflowing with water from the fountain, in which I
immersed myself every morning.&nbsp; Such were the premises to
which, after having provided <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>myself with a few indispensable
articles of furniture, I now retreated with Antonio and my two
horses.</p>
<p>I was fortunate in the possession of these quadrupeds,
inasmuch as it afforded me an opportunity of enjoying to a
greater extent the beauties of the surrounding country.&nbsp; I
know of few things in this life more delicious than a ride in the
spring or summer season in the neighbourhood of Seville.&nbsp; My
favourite one was in the direction of Xeres, over the wide
Dehesa, as it is called, which extends from Seville to the gates
of the former town, a distance of nearly fifty miles, with
scarcely a town or village intervening.&nbsp; The ground is
irregular and broken, and is for the most part covered with that
species of brushwood called <i>carrasco</i>, amongst which winds
a bridle-path, by no means well defined, chiefly trodden by the
<i>arrieros</i>, with their long trains of mules and
<i>borricos</i>.&nbsp; It is here that the balmy air of beautiful
Andalusia is to be inhaled in full perfection.&nbsp; Aromatic
herbs and flowers are growing in abundance, diffusing their
perfume around.&nbsp; Here dark and gloomy cares are dispelled as
if by magic from the bosom, as the eyes wander over the prospect,
lighted by unequalled sunshine, in which gaily painted
butterflies wanton, and green and golden <i>salamanquesas</i> lie
extended, enjoying the luxurious warmth, and occasionally
startling the traveller, by springing up and making off with
portentous speed to the nearest coverts, whence they stare upon
him with their sharp and lustrous eyes.&nbsp; I repeat, that it
is impossible to continue melancholy in regions like these, and
the ancient Greeks and Romans were right in making them the site
of their Elysian fields.&nbsp; Most beautiful they are, even in
their present desolation, for the hand of man has not <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>cultivated
them since the fatal era of the expulsion of the Moors, which
drained Andalusia of at least two-thirds of its population.</p>
<p>Every evening it was my custom to ride along the Dehesa, until
the topmost towers of Seville were no longer in sight.&nbsp; I
then turned about, and pressing my knees against the sides of
Sidi Habismilk, my Arabian, the fleet creature, to whom spur or
lash had never been applied, would set off in the direction of
the town with the speed of a whirlwind, seeming in his headlong
course to devour the ground of the waste, until he had left it
behind, then dashing through the elm-covered road of the
Delicias, his thundering hoofs were soon heard beneath the
vaulted archway of the Puerta de Xeres, and in another moment he
would stand stone-still before the door of my solitary house in
the little silent square of the Pila Seca.</p>
<p>It is eight o&rsquo;clock at night, I am returned from the
Dehesa, and am standing on the <i>sotea</i>, or flat roof of my
house, enjoying the cool breeze.&nbsp; Johannes Chrysostom has
just arrived from his labour.&nbsp; I have not spoken to him, but
I hear him below in the courtyard, detailing to Antonio the
progress he has made in the last two days.&nbsp; He speaks
barbarous Greek, plentifully interlarded with Spanish words; but
I gather from his discourse, that he has already sold twelve
Testaments among his fellow-labourers.&nbsp; I hear copper coin
falling on the pavement, and Antonio, who is not of a very
Christian temper, reproving him for not having brought the
proceeds of the sale in silver.&nbsp; He now asks for fifteen
more, as he says the demand is becoming great, and that he shall
have no difficulty in disposing of them in the course of the
morrow, whilst pursuing his occupations.&nbsp; Antonio goes to
fetch them, <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>and he now stands alone by the marble fountain, singing
a wild song, which I believe to be a hymn of his beloved Greek
Church.&nbsp; Behold one of the helpers which the Lord has sent
me in my Gospel labours on the shores of the Guadalquivir.</p>
<p>I lived in the greatest retirement during the whole time that
I passed at Seville, spending the greater part of each day in
study, or in that half dreamy state of inactivity which is the
natural effect of the influence of a warm climate.&nbsp; There
was little in the character of the people around to induce me to
enter much into society.&nbsp; The higher class of the
Andalusians are probably upon the whole the most vain and foolish
of human beings, with a taste for nothing but sensual amusements,
foppery in dress, and ribald discourse.&nbsp; Their insolence is
only equalled by their meanness, and their prodigality by their
avarice.&nbsp; The lower classes are a shade or two better than
their superiors in station: little, it is true, can be said for
the tone of their morality; they are overreaching, quarrelsome,
and revengeful, but they are upon the whole more courteous, and
certainly not more ignorant.</p>
<p>The Andalusians are in general held in the lowest estimation
by the rest of the Spaniards, even those in opulent circumstances
finding some difficulty at Madrid in procuring admission into
respectable society, where, if they find their way, they are
invariably the objects of ridicule, from the absurd airs and
grimaces in which they indulge,&mdash;their tendency to boasting
and exaggeration, their curious accent, and the incorrect manner
in which they speak and pronounce the Castilian language. <a
name="citation261"></a><a href="#footnote261"
class="citation">[261]</a></p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>In a
word, the Andalusians, in all estimable traits of character, are
as far below the other Spaniards as the country which they
inhabit is superior in beauty and fertility to the other
provinces of Spain.</p>
<p>Yet let it not for a moment be supposed that I have any
intention of asserting, that excellent and estimable individuals
are not to be found amongst the Andalusians; it was amongst
<i>them</i> that I myself discovered one, whom I have no
hesitation in asserting to be the most extraordinary character
that has ever come within the sphere of my knowledge; but this
was no scion of a noble or knightly house, &ldquo;no wearer of
soft clothing,&rdquo; no sleek highly perfumed personage, none of
the romanticos who walk in languishing attitudes about the
streets of Seville, with long black hair hanging upon their
shoulders in luxuriant curls: but one of those whom the proud and
unfeeling style the dregs of the populace, a haggard, houseless,
penniless man, in rags and tatters.&nbsp; I allude to Manuel,
the&mdash;what shall I call him?&mdash;seller of lottery tickets,
driver of death carts, or poet laureate in gypsy songs?&nbsp; I
wonder whether thou art still living, my friend Manuel; thou
gentleman of nature&rsquo;s forming&mdash;honest, pure-minded,
humble, yet dignified being!&nbsp; Art thou still wandering
through the courts of beautiful Safacoro, or on the banks of the
Len Baro, <a name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a> thine eyes fixed in vacancy, and thy
mind striving to recall some half-forgotten couplet of Luis Lobo;
or art thou gone to thy long rest, out beyond the Xeres gate
within <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>the wall of the Campo Santo, to which, in times of pest
and sickness, thou wast wont to carry so many, gypsy and Gentile,
in thy cart of the tinkling bell?&nbsp; Oft in the
<i>r&eacute;unions</i> of the lettered and learned in this land
of universal literature, when weary of the display of pedantry
and egotism, have I recurred with yearning to our gypsy
recitations at the old house in the Pila Seca.&nbsp; Oft, when
sickened by the high-wrought professions of those who bear the
cross in gilded chariots, have I thought on thee, thy calm faith,
without pretence,&mdash;thy patience in poverty, and fortitude in
affliction; and as oft, when thinking of my speedily approaching
end, have I wished that I might meet thee once again, and that
thy hands might help to bear me to &ldquo;the dead man&rsquo;s
acre&rdquo; yonder on the sunny plain, O Manuel! <a
name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263"
class="citation">[263]</a></p>
<p>My principal visitor was Dionysius, who seldom failed to make
his appearance every forenoon: the poor fellow came for sympathy
and conversation.&nbsp; It is difficult to imagine a situation
more forlorn and isolated than that of this man,&mdash;a Greek at
Seville, with scarcely a single acquaintance, and depending for
subsistence on the miserable pittance to be derived from selling
a few books, for the most part hawked about from door to
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;What could have first induced you to commence
bookselling in Seville?&rdquo; said I to him, as he arrived one
sultry day, heated and fatigued, with a small bundle of books
secured together by a leather strap.</p>
<p><i>Dionysius</i>.&mdash;For want of a better employment, <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span><i>Kyrie</i>, <a name="citation264a"></a><a
href="#footnote264a" class="citation">[264a]</a> I have adopted
this most unprofitable and despised one.&nbsp; Oft have I
regretted not having been bred up as a shoemaker, or having
learnt in my youth some other useful handicraft, for gladly would
I follow it now.&nbsp; Such, at least, would procure me the
respect of my fellow-creatures, inasmuch as they needed me; but
now all avoid me and look upon me with contempt; for what have I
to offer in this place that any one cares about?&nbsp; Books in
Seville! where no one reads, or at least nothing but new
romances, translated from the French, and obscenity.&nbsp;
Books!&nbsp; Would I were a gypsy and could trim donkeys, for
then I were at least independent and were more respected than I
am at present.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Of what kind of books does your
stock-in-trade consist?</p>
<p><i>Dionysius</i>.&mdash;Of those not likely to suit the
Seville market, <i>Kyrie</i>; books of sterling and intrinsic
value; many of them in ancient Greek, which I picked up upon the
dissolution of the convents, when the contents of the libraries
were hurled into the courtyards, and there sold by the
<i>arroba</i>.&nbsp; I thought at first that I was about to make
a fortune, and in fact my books would be so in any other place;
but here I have offered an Elzevir <a name="citation264b"></a><a
href="#footnote264b" class="citation">[264b]</a> for half a
dollar in vain.&nbsp; I should starve were it not for the
strangers who occasionally purchase of me.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Seville is a large cathedral city,
abounding with priests and canons; surely some of these
occasionally visit you to make purchases of classic works and
books connected with ecclesiastical literature.</p>
<p><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span><i>Dionysius</i>.&mdash;If you think so, <i>Kyrie</i>,
you know little respecting the ecclesiastics of Seville.&nbsp; I
am acquainted with many of them, and can assure you that a tribe
of beings can scarcely be found with a more confirmed aversion to
intellectual pursuits of every kind.&nbsp; Their reading is
confined to newspapers, which they take up in the hope of seeing
that their friend Don Carlos is at length reinstated at Madrid;
but they prefer their chocolate and biscuits, and nap before
dinner, to the wisdom of Plato and the eloquence of Tully.&nbsp;
They occasionally visit me, but it is only to pass away a heavy
hour in chattering nonsense.&nbsp; Once on a time three of them
came, in the hope of making me a convert to their Latin
superstition.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Signor Donatio</i>,&rdquo; said
they (for so they called me), &ldquo;how is it that an
unprejudiced person like yourself, a man really with some
pretension to knowledge, can still cling to this absurd religion
of yours?&nbsp; Surely, after having resided so many years in a
civilized country like this of Spain, it is high time to abandon
your half-pagan form of worship, and to enter the bosom of the
Church; now pray be advised, and you shall be none the worse for
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, gentlemen,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;for the interest you take in my welfare; I am always open
to conviction; let us proceed to discuss the subject.&nbsp; What
are the points of my religion which do not meet your
approbation?&nbsp; You are of course well acquainted with all our
dogmas and ceremonies.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We know nothing about
your religion, <i>Signor Donatio</i>, save that it is a very
absurd one, and therefore it is incumbent upon you, as an
unprejudiced and well-informed man, to renounce it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, gentlemen, if you know nothing of my religion, why
call it absurd?&nbsp; Surely it is not the part of <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>unprejudiced people to disparage that of which they are
ignorant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But, <i>Signor Donatio</i>, it is
not the Catholic Apostolic Roman religion, is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It may be, gentlemen, for what you appear to know of it;
for your information, however, I will tell you that it is not; it
is the Greek Apostolic religion.&nbsp; I do not call it catholic,
for it is absurd to call that catholic which is not universally
acknowledged.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But, <i>Signor Donatio</i>,
does not the matter speak for itself?&nbsp; What can a set of
ignorant Greek barbarians know about religion?&nbsp; If they set
aside the authority of Rome, whence should they derive any
rational ideas of religion? whence should they get the
Gospel?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Gospel, gentlemen?&nbsp; Allow me
to show you a book.&nbsp; Here it is; what is your opinion of
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Signor Donati</i>, what does this
mean?&nbsp; What characters of the devil are these, are they
Moorish?&nbsp; Who is able to understand them?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose your worships, being Roman priests, know
something of Latin; if you inspect the title-page to the bottom,
you will find, in the language of your own Church, &lsquo;the
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in the original
Greek,&rsquo; of which your Vulgate is merely a translation, and
not a very correct one.&nbsp; With respect to the barbarism of
Greece, it appears that you are not aware that Athens was a city,
and a famed one, centuries before the first mud cabin of Rome was
thatched, and the gypsy vagabonds who first peopled it had
escaped from the hands of justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Signor
Donatio</i>, you are an ignorant heretic, and insolent withal:
<i>what nonsense is this</i>! . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; But I will not
weary your ears, <i>Kyrie</i>, with all the absurdities which the
poor Latin <i>Papas</i> <a name="citation266"></a><a
href="#footnote266" class="citation">[266]</a> poured into mine;
the burden of <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>their song being invariably, <i>what nonsense is
this</i>! which was certainly applicable enough to what they
themselves were saying.&nbsp; Seeing, however, that I was more
than their match in religious controversy, they fell foul of my
country.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spain is a better country than
Greece,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never tasted bread
before you came to Spain,&rdquo; cried another.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
little enough since,&rdquo; thought I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never
before saw such a city as Seville,&rdquo; said the third.&nbsp;
But then ensued the best part of the comedy: my visitors chanced
to be natives of three different places; one was of Seville,
another of Utrera, and the third of Miguel Turra, a miserable
village in La Mancha.&nbsp; At the mention of Seville, the other
two instantly began to sing the praises of their respective
places of birth; this brought on comparisons, and a violent
dispute was the consequence.&nbsp; Much abuse passed between
them, whilst I stood by, shrugged my shoulders, and said
<i>tipotas</i>. <a name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a>&nbsp; At last, as they were leaving
the house, I said, &ldquo;Who would have thought, gentlemen, that
the polemics of the Greek and Latin Churches were so closely
connected with the comparative merits of Seville, Utrera, and
Miguel Turra?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Is the spirit of proselytism very
prevalent here?&nbsp; Of what description of people do their
converts generally consist?</p>
<p><i>Dionysius</i>.&mdash;I will tell you, <i>Kyrie</i>; the
generality of their converts consist of German or English
Protestant adventurers, who come here to settle, and in course of
time take to themselves wives from amongst the Spanish, prior to
which it is necessary to become members of the Latin
Church.&nbsp; A few are vagabond Jews, from Gibraltar or Tangier,
who have fled for <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>their crimes into Spain, and who renounce their faith
to escape from starvation.&nbsp; These gentry, however, it is
necessary to pay, on which account the priests procure for them
<i>padrinos</i>, or godfathers; these generally consist of rich
devotees over whom the priests have influence, and who esteem it
a glory and a meritorious act to assist in bringing back lost
souls to the Church.&nbsp; The neophyte allows himself to be
convinced on the promise of a <i>peseta</i> a day, which is
generally paid by the godfathers for the first year, but seldom
for a longer period.&nbsp; About forty years ago, however, they
made a somewhat notable convert.&nbsp; A civil war arose in
Morocco, caused by the separate pretensions of two brothers to
the throne.&nbsp; One of these being worsted, fled over to Spain,
imploring the protection of Charles IV.&nbsp; He soon became an
object of particular attention to the priests, who were not slow
in converting him, and induced Charles to settle upon him a
pension of a dollar per day.&nbsp; He died some few years since
in Seville, a despised vagabond.&nbsp; He left behind him a son,
who is at present a notary, and outwardly very devout, but a
greater hypocrite and <i>picaron</i> does not exist.&nbsp; I
would you could see his face, <i>Kyrie</i>, it is that of Judas
Iscariot.&nbsp; I think you would say so, for you are a
physiognomist.&nbsp; He lives next door to me, and
notwithstanding his pretensions to religion, is permitted to
remain in a state of great poverty.</p>
<p>And now nothing further for the present about Dionysius.</p>
<p>About the middle of July our work was concluded at Seville,
and for the very efficient reason that I had no more Testaments
to sell; somewhat more than two hundred having been circulated
since my arrival.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>About
ten days before the time of which I am speaking, I was visited by
various <i>alguazils</i>, accompanied by a kind of headborough,
who made a small seizure of Testaments and gypsy Gospels, which
happened to be lying about.&nbsp; This visit was far from being
disagreeable to me, as I considered it to be a very satisfactory
proof of the effect of our exertions in Seville.&nbsp; I cannot
help here relating an anecdote:&mdash;A day or two subsequent,
having occasion to call at the house of the headborough
respecting my passport, I found him lying on his bed, for it was
the hour of <i>siesta</i>, reading intently one of the Testaments
which he had taken away, all of which, if he had obeyed his
orders, would have been deposited in the office of the civil
governor.&nbsp; So intently, indeed, was he engaged in reading,
that he did not at first observe my entrance; when he did,
however, he sprang up in great confusion, and locked the book up
in his cabinet, whereupon I smiled, and told him to be under no
alarm, as I was glad to see him so usefully employed.&nbsp;
Recovering himself, he said that he had read the book nearly
through, and that he had found no harm in it, but, on the
contrary, everything to praise.&nbsp; Adding, he believed that
the clergy must be possessed with devils (<i>endemoniados</i>) to
persecute it in the manner they did.</p>
<p>It was Sunday when the seizure was made, and I happened to be
reading the Liturgy.&nbsp; One of the <i>alguazils</i>, when
going away, made an observation respecting the very different
manner in which the Protestants and Catholics keep the Sabbath;
the former being in their own houses reading good books, and the
latter abroad in the bull-ring, seeing the wild bulls tear out
the gory bowels of the poor horses.&nbsp; <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>The bull
amphitheatre at Seville is the finest in all Spain, and is
invariably on a Sunday (the only day on which it is open) filled
with applauding multitudes.</p>
<p>I now made preparations for leaving Seville for a few months,
my destination being the coast of Barbary.&nbsp; Antonio, who did
not wish to leave Spain, in which were his wife and children,
returned to Madrid, rejoicing in a handsome gratuity with which I
presented him.&nbsp; As it was my intention to return to Seville,
I left my house and horses in the charge of a friend in whom I
could confide, and departed.</p>
<p>The reasons which induced me to visit Barbary will be seen in
the following chapters.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Night on the Guadalquivir&mdash;Gospel
Light&mdash;Bonanza&mdash;Strand of San Lucar&mdash;Andalusian
Scenery&mdash;History of a Chest&mdash;Cosas de los
Ingleses&mdash;The Two Gypsies&mdash;The Driver&mdash;The Red
Nightcap&mdash;The Steam-Boat&mdash;Christian Language.</p>
<p>On the night of the 31st of July I departed from Seville upon
my expedition, going on board one of the steamers which ply on
the Guadalquivir between Seville and Cadiz.</p>
<p>It was my intention to stop at San Lucar, for the purpose of
recovering the chest of Testaments which had been placed in
embargo there, until such time as they could be removed from the
kingdom of Spain.&nbsp; These Testaments I intended for
distribution amongst the Christians whom I hoped to meet on the
shores of Barbary.&nbsp; San Lucar is about fifteen leagues
distant from Seville, at the entrance of the bay of Cadiz, where
the yellow waters of the Guadalquivir unite with the brine.&nbsp;
The steamer shot from the little quay, or wharf, at about
half-past nine, and then arose a loud cry&mdash;it was the voices
of those on board and on shore wishing farewell to their
friends.&nbsp; Amongst the tumult I thought I could distinguish
the accents of some friends of my own who had accompanied me to
the <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>bank, and I instantly raised my own voice louder than
all.&nbsp; The night was very dark, so much so, indeed, that as
we passed along we could scarcely distinguish the trees which
cover the eastern shore of the river until it takes its first
turn.&nbsp; A <i>calmazo</i> had reigned during the day at
Seville, by which is meant exceedingly sultry weather,
unenlivened by the slightest breeze.&nbsp; The night likewise was
calm and sultry.&nbsp; As I had frequently made the voyage of the
Guadalquivir, ascending and descending this celebrated river, I
felt nothing of that restlessness and curiosity which people
experience in a strange place, whether in light or darkness, and
being acquainted with none of the other passengers, who were
talking on the deck, I thought my best plan would be to retire to
the cabin and enjoy some rest, if possible.&nbsp; The cabin was
solitary and tolerably cool, all its windows on either side being
open for the admission of air.&nbsp; Flinging myself on one of
the cushioned benches, I was soon asleep, in which state I
continued for about two hours, when I was aroused by the furious
biting of a thousand bugs, which compelled me to seek the deck,
where, wrapping myself in my cloak, I again fell asleep.&nbsp; It
was near daybreak when I awoke; we were then about two leagues
from San Lucar.&nbsp; I arose and looked towards the east,
watching the gradual progress of dawn, first the dull light, then
the streak, then the tinge, then the bright blush, till at last
the golden disk of that orb which giveth day emerged from the
abyss of immensity, and in a moment the whole prospect was
covered with brightness and glory.&nbsp; The land smiled, the
waters sparkled, the birds sang, and men arose from their
resting-places and rejoiced: for it was day, and the sun was gone
forth on the errand of its <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>Creator, the diffusion of light and
gladness, and the dispelling of darkness and sorrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behold the morning sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Begins his glorious way;<br />
His beams through all the nations run,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And life and light convey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where the Gospel comes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It spreads diviner light;<br />
It calls dead sinners from their tombs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gives the blind their sight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now stopped before Bonanza: this is, properly speaking, the
port of San Lucar, although it is half a league distant from the
latter place.&nbsp; It is called Bonanza on account of its good
anchorage, and its being secured from the boisterous winds of the
ocean; its literal meaning is &ldquo;fair weather.&rdquo; <a
name="citation273"></a><a href="#footnote273"
class="citation">[273]</a>&nbsp; It consists of several large
white buildings, principally government store-houses, and is
inhabited by the coastguard, dependents on the custom-house, and
a few fishermen.&nbsp; A boat came off to receive those
passengers whose destination was San Lucar, and to bring on board
about half a dozen who were bound for Cadiz: I entered with the
rest.&nbsp; A young Spaniard of very diminutive stature addressed
some questions to me in French as to what I thought of the
scenery and climate of Andalusia.&nbsp; I replied that I admired
both, which evidently gave him great pleasure.&nbsp; The boatman
now came demanding two <i>reals</i> for conveying me on
shore.&nbsp; I had no small money, and offered him <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>a dollar to
change.&nbsp; He said that it was impossible.&nbsp; I asked him
what was to be done: whereupon he replied, uncivilly, that he
knew not, but could not lose time, and expected to be paid
instantly.&nbsp; The young Spaniard, observing my embarrassment,
took out two <i>reals</i> and paid the fellow.&nbsp; I thanked
him heartily for this act of civility, for which I felt really
grateful; as there are few situations more unpleasant than to be
in a crowd in want of change, whilst you are importuned by people
for payment.&nbsp; A loose character once told me that it was far
preferable to be without money at all, as you then knew what
course to take.&nbsp; I subsequently met the young Spaniard at
Cadiz, and repaid him, with thanks.</p>
<p>A few cabriolets were waiting near the wharf, in order to
convey us to San Lucar.&nbsp; I ascended one, and we proceeded
slowly along the <i>playa</i> or strand.&nbsp; This place is
famous in the ancient novels of Spain, of that class called
Picaresque, or those devoted to the adventures of notorious
scoundrels, the father of which, as also of others of the same
kind, in whatever language, is <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i>.&nbsp;
Cervantes himself has immortalized this strand in the most
amusing of his smaller tales, <i>La Ilustre Fregona</i>. <a
name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"
class="citation">[274]</a>&nbsp; In a word, the strand of San
Lucar in ancient times, if not in modern, was a rendezvous for
ruffians, <i>contrabandistas</i>, and vagabonds of every
description, who nested there in wooden sheds, which have now
vanished.&nbsp; San Lucar itself was always noted for the
thievish propensities of its inhabitants&mdash;the worst in all
Andalusia.&nbsp; The roguish innkeeper in Don Quixote perfected
his education at San Lucar.&nbsp; All these recollections crowded
into my mind as we proceeded along the <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>strand,
which was beautifully gilded by the Andalusian sun.&nbsp; We at
last arrived nearly opposite to San Lucar, which stands at some
distance from the waterside.&nbsp; Here a lively spectacle
presented itself to us: the shore was covered with a multitude of
females either dressing or undressing themselves, while (I speak
within bounds) hundreds were in the water, sporting and playing:
some were close by the beach, stretched at their full length on
the sand and pebbles, allowing the little billows to dash over
their heads and bosoms; whilst others were swimming boldly out
into the firth.&nbsp; There was a confused hubbub of female
cries, thin shrieks, and shrill laughter; couplets likewise were
being sung, on what subject it is easy to guess&mdash;for we were
in sunny Andalusia, and what can its black-eyed daughters think,
speak, or sing of but <i>amor</i>, <i>amor</i>, which now sounded
from the land and the waters?&nbsp; Further on along the beach we
perceived likewise a crowd of men bathing; we passed not by them,
but turned to the left up an alley or avenue which leads to San
Lucar, and which may be a quarter of a mile long.&nbsp; The view
from hence was truly magnificent: before us lay the town,
occupying the side and top of a tolerably high hill, extending
from east to west.&nbsp; It appeared to be of considerable size;
and I was subsequently informed that it contained at least twenty
thousand inhabitants.&nbsp; Several immense edifices and walls
towered up in a style of grandeur which can be but feebly
described by words; but the principal object was an ancient
castle towards the left.&nbsp; The houses were all white, and
would have shone brilliantly in the sun had it been higher; but
at this early hour they lay comparatively in shade.&nbsp; The
<i>tout ensemble</i> was very Moorish and Oriental; and, indeed,
in ancient <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>times San Lucar was a celebrated stronghold of the
Moors, and, next to Almeria, the most frequented of the
commercial places in Spain.&nbsp; Everything, indeed, in these
parts of Andalusia is perfectly Oriental.&nbsp; Behold the
heavens, as cloudless and as brightly azure as those of Ind; the
fiery sun which tans the fairest cheek in a moment, and which
fills the air with flickering flame; and oh! remark the scenery
and the vegetable productions.&nbsp; The alley up which we were
moving was planted on each side with that remarkable tree or
plant, for I know not which to call it, the giant aloe, which is
called in Spanish, <i>pita</i>, and in Moorish,
<i>gurs&eacute;an</i>.&nbsp; It rises here to a height almost as
magnificent as on the African shore.&nbsp; Need I say that the
stem, which springs up from the middle of the bush of green
blades, which shoot out from the root on all sides, is as high as
a palm-tree; and need I say that those blades, which are of an
immense thickness at the root, are at the tip sharper than the
point of a spear, and would inflict a terrible wound on any
animal which might inadvertently rush against them?</p>
<p>One of the first houses at San Lucar was the <i>posada</i> at
which we stopped.&nbsp; It confronted, with some others, the
avenue up which we had come.&nbsp; As it was still early, I
betook myself to rest for a few hours, at the end of which time I
went out to visit Mr. Phillipi, the British vice-consul, who was
already acquainted with me by name, as I had been recommended to
him in a letter from a relation of his at Seville.&nbsp; Mr.
Phillipi was at home in his counting-house, and received me with
much kindness and civility.&nbsp; I told him the motive of my
visit to San Lucar, and requested his assistance towards
obtaining the books from the custom-house, in order to transport
them out of the <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>country, as I was very well acquainted with the
difficulties which every one has to encounter in Spain who has
any business to transact with the government authorities.&nbsp;
He assured me that he should be most happy to assist me; and,
accordingly, despatched with me to the custom-house his head
clerk, a person well known and much respected at San Lucar.</p>
<p>It may be as well here at once to give the history of these
books, which might otherwise tend to embarrass the
narrative.&nbsp; They consisted of a chest of Testaments in
Spanish, and a small box of Saint Luke&rsquo;s Gospel in the
<i>Gitano</i> language of the Spanish gypsies.&nbsp; I obtained
them from the custom-house at San Lucar, with a pass for that of
Cadiz.&nbsp; At Cadiz I was occupied two days, and also a person
whom I employed, in going through all the formalities, and in
procuring the necessary papers.&nbsp; The expense was great, as
money was demanded at every step I had to take, though I was
simply complying, in this instance, with the orders of the
Spanish government in removing prohibited books from Spain.&nbsp;
The farce did not end until my arrival at Gibraltar, where I paid
the Spanish consul a dollar for certifying on the back of the
pass, which I had to return to Cadiz, that the books were arrived
at the former place.&nbsp; It is true that he never saw the
books, nor inquired about them; but he received the money, for
which he alone seemed to be anxious.</p>
<p>Whilst at the custom-house of San Lucar I was asked one or two
questions respecting the books contained in the chests: this
afforded me some opportunity of speaking of the New Testament and
the Bible Society.&nbsp; What I said excited attention; and
presently all the officers and dependents of the house, <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>great and
small, were gathered around me, from the governor to the
porter.&nbsp; As it was necessary to open the boxes to inspect
their contents, we all proceeded to the courtyard, where, holding
a Testament in my hand, I recommenced my discourse.&nbsp; I
scarcely know what I said; for I was much agitated, and hurried
away by my feelings, when I bethought me of the manner in which
the Word of God was persecuted in this unhappy kingdom.&nbsp; My
words evidently made impression, and to my astonishment every
person present pressed me for a copy.&nbsp; I sold several within
the walls of the custom-house.&nbsp; The object, however, of most
attention was the gypsy Gospel, which was minutely examined
amidst smiles and exclamations of surprise; an individual every
now and then crying, &ldquo;<i>Cosas de los
Ingleses</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; A bystander asked me whether I could
speak the <i>Gitano</i> language.&nbsp; I replied that I could
not only speak it, but write it, and instantly made a speech of
about five minutes in the gypsy tongue, which I had no sooner
concluded than all clapped their hands and simultaneously
shouted, &ldquo;<i>Cosas de Inglaterra</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Cosas de los Ingleses</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I disposed of
several copies of the gypsy Gospel likewise, and having now
settled the business which had brought me to the custom-house, I
saluted my new friends and departed with my books.</p>
<p>I now revisited Mr. Phillipi, who, upon learning that it was
my intention to proceed to Cadiz next morning by the steamer,
which would touch at Bonanza at four o&rsquo;clock, despatched
the chests and my little luggage to the latter place, where he
likewise advised me to sleep, in order that I might be in
readiness to embark at that early hour.&nbsp; He then introduced
me to his family, his wife an English woman, and his daughter <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>an amiable
and beautiful girl of about eighteen years of age, whom I had
previously seen at Seville; three or four other ladies from
Seville were likewise there on a visit, and for the purpose of
sea-bathing.&nbsp; After a few words in English between the lady
of the house and myself, we all commenced chatting in Spanish,
which seemed to be the only language understood or cared for by
the rest of the company; indeed, who would be so unreasonable as
to expect Spanish females to speak any language but their own,
which, flexible and harmonious as it is (far more so, I think,
than any other), seems at times quite inadequate to express the
wild sallies of their luxuriant imagination.&nbsp; Two hours fled
rapidly away in discourse, interrupted occasionally by music and
song, when I bade farewell to this delightful society, and
strolled out to view the town.</p>
<p>It was now past noon, and the heat was exceedingly fierce: I
saw scarcely a living being in the streets, the stones of which
burnt my feet through the soles of my boots.&nbsp; I passed
through the square of the Constitution, which presents nothing
particular to the eye of the stranger, and ascended the hill to
obtain a nearer view of the castle.&nbsp; It is a strong heavy
edifice of stone, with round towers, and, though deserted,
appears to be still in a tolerable state of preservation.&nbsp; I
became tired of gazing, and was retracing my steps, when I was
accosted by two gypsies, who by some means had heard of my
arrival.&nbsp; We exchanged some words in <i>Gitano</i>, but they
appeared to be very ignorant of the dialect, and utterly unable
to maintain a conversation in it.&nbsp; They were clamorous for a
<i>gabicote</i>, or book in the gypsy tongue.&nbsp; I refused it
them, saying that they could turn it to no <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>profitable
account; but finding that they could read, I promised them each a
Testament in Spanish.&nbsp; This offer, however, they refused
with disdain, saying that they cared for nothing written in the
language of the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> or Gentiles.&nbsp; They then
persisted in their demand, to which I at last yielded, being
unable to resist their importunity; whereupon they accompanied me
to the inn, and received what they so ardently desired.</p>
<p>In the evening I was visited by Mr. Phillipi, who informed me
that he had ordered a cabriolet to call for me at the inn at
eleven at night, for the purpose of conveying me to Bonanza, and
that a person there, who kept a small wine-house, and to whom the
chests and other things had been forwarded, would receive me for
the night, though it was probable that I should have to sleep on
the floor.&nbsp; We then walked to the beach, where there were a
great number of bathers, all men.&nbsp; Amongst them were some
good swimmers; two, in particular, were out at a great distance
in the firth of the Guadalquivir, I should say at least a mile;
their heads could just be descried with the telescope.&nbsp; I
was told that they were friars.&nbsp; I wondered at what period
of their lives they had acquired their dexterity at
natation.&nbsp; I hoped it was not at a time when, according to
their vows, they should have lived for prayer, fasting, and
mortification alone.&nbsp; Swimming is a noble exercise, but it
certainly does not tend to mortify either the flesh or the
spirit.&nbsp; As it was becoming dusk, we returned to the town,
when my friend bade me a kind farewell.&nbsp; I then retired to
my apartment, and passed some hours in meditation.</p>
<p>It was night, ten o&rsquo;clock;&mdash;eleven o&rsquo;clock,
and the cabriolet was at the door.&nbsp; I got in, and we
proceeded <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>down the avenue and along the shore, which was quite
deserted.&nbsp; The waves sounded mournfully; everything seemed
to have changed since the morning.&nbsp; I even thought that the
horse&rsquo;s feet sounded differently as it trotted slowly over
the moist firm sand.&nbsp; The driver, however, was by no means
mournful, nor inclined to be silent long: he soon commenced
asking me an infinity of questions as to whence I came and
whither I was bound.&nbsp; Having given him what answers I
thought most proper, I, in return, asked him whether he was not
afraid to drive along that beach, which had always borne so bad a
character, at so unseasonable an hour.&nbsp; Whereupon he looked
around him, and seeing no person, he raised a shout of derision,
and said that a fellow with his whiskers feared not all the
thieves that ever walked the <i>playa</i>, and that no dozen men
in San Lucar dare to waylay any traveller whom they knew to be
beneath his protection.&nbsp; He was a good specimen of the
Andalusian braggart.&nbsp; We soon saw a light or two shining
dimly before us; they proceeded from a few barks and small
vessels stranded on the sand close below Bonanza: amongst them I
distinguished two or three dusky figures.&nbsp; We were now at
our journey&rsquo;s end, and stopped before the door of the place
where I was to lodge for the night.&nbsp; The driver,
dismounting, knocked loud and long, until the door was opened by
an exceedingly stout man of about sixty years of age; he held a
dim light in his hand, and was dressed in a red nightcap and
dirty striped shirt.&nbsp; He admitted us, without a word, into a
very large long room with a clay floor.&nbsp; A species of
counter stood on one side near the door; behind it stood a barrel
or two, and against the wall, on shelves, many bottles of various
sizes.&nbsp; The smell of liquors <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>and wine was very powerful.&nbsp; I
settled with the driver and gave him a gratuity, whereupon he
asked me for something to drink to my safe journey.&nbsp; I told
him he could call for whatever he pleased: whereupon he demanded
a glass of <i>aguardiente</i>, which the master of the house, who
had stationed himself behind the counter, handed him without
saying a word.&nbsp; The fellow drank it off at once, but made a
great many wry faces after having swallowed it, and, coughing,
said that he made no doubt it was good liquor, as it burnt his
throat terribly.&nbsp; He then embraced me, went out, mounted his
cabriolet, and drove off.</p>
<p>The old man with the red nightcap now moved slowly to the
door, which he bolted and otherwise secured; he then drew forward
two benches, which he placed together, and pointed to them as if
to intimate to me that there was my bed: he then blew out the
candle and retired deeper into the apartment, where I heard him
lay himself down sighing and snorting.&nbsp; There was now no
further light than what proceeded from a small earthen pan on the
floor, filled with water and oil, on which floated a small piece
of card with a lighted wick in the middle, which simple species
of lamp is called <i>mariposa</i>. <a name="citation282"></a><a
href="#footnote282" class="citation">[282]</a>&nbsp; I now laid
my carpet-bag on the bench as a pillow, and flung myself
down.&nbsp; I should have been asleep instantly, but he of the
red nightcap now commenced snoring awfully, which brought to my
mind that I had not yet commended myself to my Friend and
Redeemer: I therefore prayed, and then sank to repose.</p>
<p>I was awakened more than once during the night by cats, and I
believe rats, leaping upon my body.&nbsp; At the last of these
interruptions I arose, and, <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>approaching the <i>mariposa</i>,
looked at my watch; it was half-past three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I
opened the door and looked out; whereupon some fishermen entered,
clamouring for their morning draught: the old man was soon on his
feet serving them.&nbsp; One of the men said to me, that if I was
going by the steamer, I had better order my things to the wharf
without delay, as he had heard the vessel coming down the
river.&nbsp; I despatched my luggage, and then demanded of the
red nightcap what I owed him.&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;<i>Un
real</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were the only two words which I
heard proceed from his mouth: he was certainly addicted to
silence, and perhaps to philosophy, neither of which are much
practised in Andalusia.&nbsp; I now hurried to the wharf.&nbsp;
The steamer was not yet arrived, but I heard its thunder up the
river every moment becoming more distinct: there were mist and
darkness upon the face of the waters, and I felt awe as I
listened to the approach of the invisible monster booming through
the stillness of the night.&nbsp; It came at last in sight,
plashed its way forward, stopped, and I was soon on board.&nbsp;
It was the <i>Peninsula</i>, the best boat on the
Guadalquivir.</p>
<p>What a wonderful production of art is a steamboat! and yet why
should we call it wonderful, if we consider its history?&nbsp;
More than five hundred years have elapsed since the idea of
making one first originated; but it was not until the close of
the last century that the first, worthy of the name, made its
appearance on a Scottish river.</p>
<p>During this long period of time, acute minds and skilful hands
were occasionally busied in attempting to remove those
imperfections in the machinery which alone prevented a vessel
being made capable of propelling itself against wind and
tide.&nbsp; All these attempts <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>were successively abandoned in
despair, yet scarcely one was made which was perfectly fruitless;
each inventor leaving behind him some monument of his labour, of
which those who succeeded him took advantage, until at last a
fortunate thought or two, and a few more perfect arrangements,
were all that were wanting.&nbsp; The time arrived, and now, at
length, the very Atlantic is crossed by haughty steamers.&nbsp;
Much has been said of the utility of steam in spreading abroad
civilization, and I think justly.&nbsp; When the first
steam-vessels were seen on the Guadalquivir, about ten years ago,
the Sevillians ran to the banks of the river, crying
&ldquo;sorcery, sorcery,&rdquo; which idea was not a little
favoured by the speculation being an English one, and the boats,
which were English built, being provided with English engineers,
as, indeed, they still are; no Spaniard having been found capable
of understanding the machinery.&nbsp; They soon, however, became
accustomed to them, and the boats are in general crowded with
passengers.&nbsp; Fanatic and vain as the Sevillians still are,
and bigoted as they remain to their own customs, they know that
good, in one instance at least, can proceed from a foreign land,
and that land a land of heretics; inveterate prejudice has been
shaken, and we will hope that this is the dawn of their
civilization.</p>
<p>Whilst passing over the bay of Cadiz, I was reclining on one
of the benches on the deck, when the captain walked by in company
with another man; they stopped a short distance from me, and I
heard the captain ask the other, in a low voice, how many
languages he spoke; he replied, &ldquo;Only one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;is of course the
Christian;&rdquo; by which name the Spaniards style their own
language, in <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>contradistinction to all others.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
fellow,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;who is lying on the
deck, can speak Christian too, when it serves his purpose, but he
speaks others, which are by no means Christian: he can talk
English, and I myself have heard him chatter in <i>Gitano</i>
with the gypsies of Triana; he is now going amongst the Moors,
and when he arrives in their country you will hear him, should
you be there, converse as fluently in their gibberish as in
<i>Cristiano</i>, nay, better, for he is no Christian
himself.&nbsp; He has been several times on board my vessel
already, but I do not like him, as I consider that he carries
something about with him which is not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This worthy person, on my coming aboard the boat, had shaken
me by the hand and expressed his joy at seeing me again.</p>

Muza&mdash;Orestes Frigate&mdash;The Hostile Lion&mdash;Works of

<p>Cadiz stands, as is well known, upon a long narrow neck of
land stretching out into the ocean, from whose bosom the town
appears to rise, the salt waters laving its walls on all sides
save the east, where a sandy isthmus connects it with the coast
of Spain.&nbsp; The town, as it exists at the present day, is of
modern construction, and very unlike any other town which is to
be found in the Peninsula, being built with great regularity and
symmetry.&nbsp; The streets are numerous, and intersect each
other, for the most part at right angles.&nbsp; They are very
narrow in comparison to the height of the houses, so that they
are almost impervious to the rays of the sun, except when at its
midday altitude.&nbsp; The principal street, however, is an
exception, it being of some width.&nbsp; This street, in which
stands the Bolsa, or exchange, and which contains the houses of
the chief merchants and nobility, is the grand resort of loungers
as well as men of business during the early part of the day, and
in that <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>respect resembles the Puerta del Sol at Madrid.&nbsp;
It is connected with the great square, which, though not of very
considerable extent, has many pretensions to magnificence, it
being surrounded with large imposing houses, and planted with
fine trees, with marble seats below them for the accommodation of
the public.&nbsp; There are few public edifices worthy of much
attention: the chief church, indeed, might be considered a fine
monument of labour in some other countries; but in Spain, the
land of noble and gigantic cathedrals, it can be styled nothing
more than a decent place of worship; it is still in an unfinished
state.&nbsp; There is a public walk, or <i>alameda</i>, on the
northern ramparts, which is generally thronged in summer
evenings: the green of its trees, when viewed from the bay,
affords an agreeable relief to the eye, dazzled with the glare of
the white buildings, for Cadiz is also a bright city.&nbsp; It
was once the wealthiest place in all Spain, but its prosperity
has of late years sadly diminished, and its inhabitants are
continually lamenting its ruined trade; on which account many are
daily abandoning it for Seville, where living at least is
cheaper.&nbsp; There is still, however, much life and bustle in
the streets, which are adorned with many splendid shops, several
of which are in the style of Paris and London.&nbsp; The present
population is said to amount to eighty thousand souls.</p>
<p>It is not without reason that Cadiz has been called a strong
town: the fortifications on the land side, which were partly the
work of the French during the sway of Napoleon, are perfectly
admirable, and seem impregnable: towards the sea it is defended
as much by nature as by art, water and sunken rocks being no
contemptible bulwarks.&nbsp; The defences of the town, <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>however,
except the landward ones, afford melancholy proofs of Spanish
apathy and neglect, even when allowance is made for the present
peculiarly unhappy circumstances of the country.&nbsp; Scarcely a
gun, except a few dismounted ones, is to be seen on the
fortifications, which are rapidly falling to decay, so that this
insulated stronghold is at present almost at the mercy of any
foreign nation which, upon any pretence, or none at all, should
seek to tear it from the grasp of its present legitimate
possessors, and convert it into a foreign colony.</p>
<p>A few hours after my arrival, I waited upon Mr. B---, <a
name="citation288"></a><a href="#footnote288"
class="citation">[288]</a> the British consul-general at
Cadiz.&nbsp; His house, which is the corner one at the entrance
of the <i>alameda</i>, commands a noble prospect of the bay, and
is very large and magnificent.&nbsp; I had, of course, long been
acquainted with Mr. B--- by reputation; I knew that for several
years he had filled, with advantage to his native country, and
with honour to himself, the distinguished and highly responsible
situation which he holds in Spain.&nbsp; I knew, likewise, that
he was a good and pious Christian, and, moreover, the firm and
enlightened friend of the Bible Society.&nbsp; Of all this I was
aware, but I had never yet enjoyed the advantage of being
personally acquainted with him.&nbsp; I saw him now for the first
time, and was much struck with his appearance.&nbsp; He is a
tall, athletic, finely built man, seemingly about forty-five or
fifty; there is much dignity in his countenance, which is,
however, softened by an expression of good humour truly
engaging.&nbsp; His manner is frank and affable in the
extreme.&nbsp; I am not going to enter into minute details of our
interview, which was to me a very interesting one.&nbsp; <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>He knew
already the leading parts of my history since my arrival in
Spain, and made several comments upon it, which displayed his
intimate knowledge of the situation of the country as regards
ecclesiastical matters, and the state of opinion respecting
religious innovation.</p>
<p>I was pleased to find that his ideas in many points accorded
with my own, and we were both decidedly of opinion that,
notwithstanding the great persecution and outcry which had lately
been raised against the Gospel, the battle was by no means lost,
and that the holy cause might yet triumph in Spain, if zeal
united with discretion and Christian humility were displayed by
those called upon to uphold it.</p>
<p>During the greater part of this and the following day, I was
much occupied at the custom-house, endeavouring to obtain the
documents necessary for the exportation of the Testaments.&nbsp;
On the afternoon of Saturday I dined with Mr. B--- and his
family&mdash;an interesting group&mdash;his lady, his beautiful
daughters, and his son, a fine intelligent young man.&nbsp; Early
the next morning a steamer, the <i>Balear</i>, was to quit Cadiz
for Marseilles, touching on the way at Algeziras, Gibraltar, and
various other ports of Spain.&nbsp; I had engaged my passage on
board her as far as Gibraltar, having nothing further to detain
me at Cadiz; my business with the custom-house having been
brought at last to a termination, though I believe I should never
have got through it but for the kind assistance of Mr.
B---.&nbsp; I quitted this excellent man and my other charming
friends at a late hour with regret.&nbsp; I believe that I
carried with me their very best wishes; and, in whatever part of
the world I, a poor wanderer in the Gospel&rsquo;s cause, may
chance to be, I shall not <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>unfrequently offer up sincere
prayers for their happiness and well-being.</p>
<p>Before taking leave of Cadiz I shall relate an anecdote of the
British consul, characteristic of him and the happy manner in
which he contrives to execute the most disagreeable duties of his
situation.&nbsp; I was in conversation with him in a parlour of
his house, when we were interrupted by the entrance of two very
unexpected visitors: they were the captain of a Liverpool
merchant-vessel and one of the crew.&nbsp; The latter was a rough
sailor, a Welshman, who could only express himself in very
imperfect English.&nbsp; They looked unutterable dislike and
defiance at each other.&nbsp; It appeared that the latter had
refused to work, and insisted on leaving the ship, and his master
had in consequence brought him before the consul, in order that,
if he persisted, the consequences might be detailed to him, which
would be the forfeiture of his wages and clothes.&nbsp; This was
done; but the fellow became more and more dogged, refusing ever
to tread the same deck again with his captain, who, he said, had
called him &ldquo;Greek, lazy lubberly Greek,&rdquo; which he
would not bear. The word Greek rankled in the sailor&rsquo;s
mind, and stung him to the very core.&nbsp; Mr. B---, who seemed
to be perfectly acquainted with the character of Welshmen in
general&mdash;who are proverbially obstinate when opposition is
offered to them&mdash;and who saw at once that the dispute had
arisen on foolish and trivial grounds, now told the man, with a
smile, that he would inform him of a way by which he might gain
the weather-gage of every one of them, consul, and captain, and
all, and secure his wages and clothes; which was by merely going
on board a brig-of-war of her Majesty, which was then lying in
the bay.&nbsp; The fellow said he was <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>aware of this, and intended to do
so.&nbsp; His grim features, however, instantly relaxed in some
degree, and he looked more humanely upon his captain.&nbsp; Mr.
B--- then, addressing himself to the latter, made some
observations on the impropriety of using the word Greek to a
British sailor: not forgetting at the same time to speak of the
absolute necessity of obedience and discipline on board every
ship.&nbsp; His words produced such an effect, that in a very
little time the sailor held out his hand towards his captain, and
expressed his willingness to go on board with him and perform his
duty, adding, that the captain, upon the whole, was the best man
in the world.&nbsp; So they departed mutually pleased; the consul
making both of them promise to attend divine service at his house
on the following day.</p>
<p>Sunday morning came, and I was on board the steamer by six
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; As I ascended the side, the harsh sound of
the Catalan dialect assailed my ears.&nbsp; In fact, the vessel
was Catalan built, and the captain and crew were of that nation;
the greater part of the passengers already on board, or who
subsequently arrived, appeared to be Catalans, and seemed to vie
with each other in producing disagreeable sounds.&nbsp; A burly
merchant, however, with a red face, peaked chin, sharp eyes, and
hooked nose, clearly bore off the palm; he conversed with
astonishing eagerness on seemingly the most indifferent subjects,
or rather on no subject at all; his voice would have sounded
exactly like a coffee-mill but for a vile nasal twang: he poured
forth his Catalan incessantly till we arrived at Gibraltar.&nbsp;
Such people are never sea-sick, though they frequently produce or
aggravate the malady in others.&nbsp; We did not get under way
until past eight <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>o&rsquo;clock, for we waited for the Governor of
Algeziras, and started instantly on his coming on board.&nbsp; He
was a tall, thin, rigid figure of about seventy, with a long,
grave, wrinkled countenance; in a word, the very image of an old
Spanish grandee.&nbsp; We stood out of the bay, rounding the
lofty lighthouse, which stands on a ledge of rocks, and then bent
our course to the south, in the direction of the Straits.&nbsp;
It was a glorious morning, a blue sunny sky and blue sunny ocean;
or rather, as my friend Oehlenschl&aelig;ger <a
name="citation292a"></a><a href="#footnote292a"
class="citation">[292a]</a> has observed on a similar occasion,
there appeared two skies and two suns, one above and one
below.</p>
<p>Our progress was rather slow, notwithstanding the fineness of
the weather, probably owing to the tide being against us.&nbsp;
In about two hours we passed the Castle of Santa Petra, and at
noon were in sight of Trafalgar.&nbsp; The wind now freshened,
and was dead ahead; on which account we hugged closely to the
coast, in order to avoid as much as possible the strong heavy sea
which was pouring down from the Straits.&nbsp; We passed within a
very short distance of the Cape, a bold bluff foreland, but not
of any considerable height.</p>
<p>It is impossible for an Englishman to pass by this
place&mdash;the scene of the most celebrated naval action on
record&mdash;without emotion.&nbsp; Here it was that the united
navies of France and Spain were annihilated by a far inferior
force; but that force was British, and was directed by one of the
most remarkable men of the age, and perhaps the greatest hero of
any time. <a name="citation292b"></a><a href="#footnote292b"
class="citation">[292b]</a>&nbsp; Huge fragments of wreck still
frequently emerge from <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>the watery gulf whose billows chafe
the rocky sides of Trafalgar: they are relics of the enormous
ships which were burnt and sunk on that terrible day, when the
heroic champion of Britain concluded his work and died.&nbsp; I
never heard but one individual venture to say a word in
disparagement of Nelson&rsquo;s glory: it was a pert American, <a
name="citation293a"></a><a href="#footnote293a"
class="citation">[293a]</a> who observed, that the British
admiral was much overrated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can that individual be
overrated,&rdquo; replied a stranger, &ldquo;whose every thought
was bent on his country&rsquo;s honour, who scarcely ever fought
without leaving a piece of his body in the fray, and who, not to
speak of minor triumphs, was victorious, in two such actions as
Aboukir and Trafalgar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were now soon in sight of the Moorish coast, Cape Spartel
appearing dimly through mist and vapour on our right.&nbsp; A
regular Levanter <a name="citation293b"></a><a
href="#footnote293b" class="citation">[293b]</a> had now come on,
and the vessel pitched and tossed to a very considerable
degree.&nbsp; Most of the passengers were seasick; the governor,
however, and myself held out manfully: we sat on a bench
together, and entered into conversation respecting the Moors and
their country.&nbsp; Torquemada himself could not have spoken of
both with more abhorrence.&nbsp; He informed me that he had been
frequently in several of the principal Moorish towns of the
coast, which he described as heaps of ruins: the Moors themselves
he called <i>Caffres</i> <a name="citation293c"></a><a
href="#footnote293c" class="citation">[293c]</a> and wild
beasts.&nbsp; He observed that he had <a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>never been even at Tangier, where
the people were most civilized, without experiencing some insult,
so great was the abhorrence of the Moors to anything in the shape
of a Christian.&nbsp; He added, however, that they treated the
English with comparative civility, and that they had a saying
among them to the effect that Englishman and Mahometan were one
and the same: he then looked particularly grave for a moment,
and, crossing himself, was silent.&nbsp; I guessed what was
passing in his mind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From heretic boors,<br />
And Turkish Moors,<br />
Star of the sea,<br />
Gentle Marie,<br />
Deliver me!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At about three we were passing Tarifa, so frequently mentioned
in the history of Moors and Christians.&nbsp; Who has not heard
of Alonzo Guzman the Faithful, <a name="citation294"></a><a
href="#footnote294" class="citation">[294]</a> who allowed his
only son to be crucified before the walls of the town rather than
submit to the ignominy of delivering up the keys to the Moorish
monarch, who, with a host which is said to have amounted to
nearly half a million of men, had landed on the shores of
Andalusia, and threatened to bring all Spain once more beneath
the Moslem yoke?&nbsp; Certainly if there be a land and a spot
where the name of that good patriot is not sometimes mentioned
and sung, that land, that spot, is modern Spain and modern
Tarifa.&nbsp; <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>I have heard the ballad of Alonzo Guzman chanted in
Danish, by a hind in the wilds of Jutland; but once speaking of
&ldquo;the Faithful&rdquo; to some inhabitants of Tarifa, they
replied that they had never heard of Guzman the Faithful of
Tarifa, but were acquainted with Alonzo Guzman, <i>el tuerto</i>,
and that he was one of the most villanous <i>arrieros</i> on the
Cadiz road.</p>
<p>The voyage of these narrow seas can scarcely fail to be
interesting to the most apathetic individual, from the nature of
the scenery which presents itself to the eye on either
side.&nbsp; The coasts are exceedingly high and bold, especially
that of Spain, which seems to overcrow the Moorish; but opposite
to Tarifa, the African continent, rounding towards the
south-west, assumes an air of sublimity and grandeur.&nbsp; A
hoary mountain is seen uplifting its summits above the clouds: it
is Mount Abyla, or, as it is called in the Moorish tongue, Gibil
Muza, or the hill of Muza, from the circumstance of its
containing the sepulchre of a prophet of that name. <a
name="citation295"></a><a href="#footnote295"
class="citation">[295]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the two
excrescences of nature on which the Old World bestowed the title
of the Pillars of Hercules.&nbsp; Its skirts and sides occupy the
Moorish coast for many leagues in more than one direction, but
the broad aspect of its steep and stupendous front is turned full
towards that part of the European continent where Gibraltar lies
like a huge monster stretching far into the brine.&nbsp; Of the
two hills, or pillars, the most remarkable, when viewed from
afar, is the African one, Gibil Muza.&nbsp; It is the tallest and
bulkiest, and is visible at a greater <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>distance; but scan them both from
near, and you feel that all your wonder is engrossed by the
European column.&nbsp; Gibil Muza is an immense shapeless mass, a
wilderness of rocks, with here and there a few trees and shrubs
nodding from the clefts of its precipices; it is uninhabited,
save by wolves, wild swine, and chattering monkeys, on which last
account it is called by the Spaniards, <i>Monta&ntilde;a de las
Monas</i>, <a name="citation296a"></a><a href="#footnote296a"
class="citation">[296a]</a> whilst, on the contrary, Gibraltar,
not to speak of the strange city which covers part of it, a city
inhabited by men of all nations and tongues, its batteries and
excavations, all of them miracles of art, is the most
singular-looking mountain in the world&mdash;a mountain which can
neither be described by pen nor pencil, and at which the eye is
never satiated with gazing.</p>
<p>It was near sunset, and we were crossing the bay of
Gibraltar.&nbsp; We had stopped at Algeziras, on the Spanish
side, for the purpose of landing the old governor and his suite,
and delivering and receiving letters.</p>
<p>Algeziras is an ancient Moorish town, as the name denotes,
which is an Arabic word, and signifies &ldquo;the place of the
islands.&rdquo; <a name="citation296b"></a><a
href="#footnote296b" class="citation">[296b]</a>&nbsp; It is
situated at the water&rsquo;s edge, with a lofty range of
mountains in the rear.&nbsp; It seemed a sad deserted place, as
far as I could judge at the distance of half a mile.&nbsp; In the
harbour, however, lay a Spanish frigate and French war
brig.&nbsp; As we passed the former, some of the Spaniards on
board our steamer became boastful at the expense of the
English.&nbsp; It appeared that, a few weeks before, an English
vessel, suspected to be a contraband trader, was seen by this
frigate hovering about a bay on the <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>Andalusian coast, in company with an
English frigate, the <i>Orestes</i>.&nbsp; The Spaniard dogged
them for some time, till one morning, observing that the
<i>Orestes</i> had disappeared, he hoisted English colours, and
made a signal to the trader to bear down; the latter, deceived by
the British ensign, and supposing that the Spaniard was the
friendly <i>Orestes</i>, instantly drew near, was fired at and
boarded, and, proving in effect to be a contraband trader, she
was carried into port and delivered over to the Spanish
authorities.&nbsp; In a few days the captain of the
<i>Orestes</i> hearing of this, and incensed at the unwarrantable
use made of the British flag, sent a boat on board the frigate,
demanding that the vessel should be instantly restored, as, if
she was not, he would retake her by force; adding, that he had
forty cannons on board.&nbsp; The captain of the Spanish frigate
returned for answer, that the trader was in the hands of the
officers of the customs, and was no longer at his disposal; that
the captain of the <i>Orestes</i>, however, could do what he
pleased, and that if he had forty guns, he himself had
forty-four; whereupon the <i>Orestes</i> thought proper to bear
away.&nbsp; Such at least was the Spanish account, as related by
the journals.&nbsp; Observing the Spaniards to be in great glee
at the idea of one of their nation having frightened away the
Englishman, I exclaimed, &ldquo;Gentlemen, all of you who suppose
that an English sea-captain has been deterred from attacking a
Spaniard, from an apprehension of a superior force of four guns,
remember, if you please, the fate of the <i>Sant&iacute;sima
Trinidad</i>, and be pleased also not to forget that we are
almost within cannon&rsquo;s sound of Trafalgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was near sunset, I repeat, and we were crossing the bay of
Gibraltar.&nbsp; I stood on the prow of the <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>vessel,
with my eyes intently fixed on the mountain fortress, which,
though I had seen it several times before, filled my mind with
admiration and interest.&nbsp; Viewed from this situation, it
certainly, if it resembles any animate object in nature, has
something of the appearance of a terrible couchant lion, whose
stupendous head menaces Spain.&nbsp; Had I been dreaming, I
should almost have concluded it to be the genius of Africa, in
the shape of its most puissant monster, who had bounded over the
sea from the clime of sand and sun, bent on the destruction of
the rival continent, more especially as the hue of its stony
sides, its crest and chine, is tawny even as that of the hide of
the desert king.&nbsp; A hostile lion has it almost invariably
proved to Spain, at least since it first began to play a part in
history, which was at the time when Tarik seized and fortified
it. <a name="citation298"></a><a href="#footnote298"
class="citation">[298]</a>&nbsp; It has for the most part been in
the hands of foreigners: first the swarthy and turbaned Moor
possessed it, and it is now tenanted by a fair-haired race from a
distant isle.&nbsp; Though a part of Spain, it seems to disavow
the connexion, and at the end of a long narrow sandy isthmus,
almost level with the sea, raising its blasted and perpendicular
brow to denounce the crimes which deformed the history of that
fair and majestic land.</p>
<p>It was near sunset, I say it for the third time, and we were
crossing the bay of Gibraltar.&nbsp; Bay! it seemed no bay, but
an inland sea, surrounded on all sides by enchanted barriers, so
strange, so wonderful was the aspect of its coasts.&nbsp; Before
us lay the impregnable hill; on our right the African continent,
with its grey Gibil Muza, and the crag of Ceuta, to which last a
<a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>solitary
bark seemed steering its way; behind us the town we had just
quitted, with its mountain wall; on our left the coast of
Spain.&nbsp; The surface of the water was unruffled by a wave,
and as we rapidly glided on, the strange object which we were
approaching became momentarily more distinct and visible.&nbsp;
There, at the base of the mountain, and covering a small portion
of its side, lay the city, with its ramparts garnished with black
guns, pointing significantly at its moles and harbours; above,
seemingly on every crag which could be made available for the
purpose of defence or destruction, peered batteries, pale and
sepulchral looking, as if ominous of the fate which awaited any
intrusive foe; whilst east and west towards Africa and Spain, on
the extreme points, rose castles, towers, or <i>atalayas</i>,
which overcrowed the whole, and all the circumjacent region,
whether land or sea.&nbsp; Mighty and threatening appeared the
fortifications, and doubtless, viewed in any other situation,
would have alone occupied the mind and engrossed its wonder; but
the hill, the wondrous hill was everywhere about them, beneath
them, or above them, overpowering their effect as a
spectacle.&nbsp; Who, when he beholds the enormous elephant, with
his brandished trunk, dashing impetuously to the war, sees the
castle which he bears, or fears the javelins of those whom he
carries, however skilful and warlike they may be?&nbsp; Never
does God appear so great and powerful as when the works of his
hands stand in contrast with the labours of man.&nbsp; Survey the
Escurial; it is a proud work, but wonder if you can when you see
the mountain mocking it behind; survey that boast of Moorish
kings, survey Granada from its plain, and wonder if you can, for
you see the Alpujarras mocking it from behind.&nbsp; Oh, <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>what are
the works of man compared with those of the Lord?&nbsp; Even as
man is compared with his Creator.&nbsp; Man builds pyramids, and
God builds pyramids; the pyramids of man are heaps of shingles,
tiny hillocks on a sandy plain; the pyramids of the Lord are
Andes and Indian hills.&nbsp; Man builds walls, and so does his
Master; but the walls of God are the black precipices of
Gibraltar and Horneel, eternal, indestructible, and not to be
scaled; whilst those of man can be climbed, can be broken by the
wave, or shattered by the lightning or the powder blast.&nbsp;
Would man display his power and grandeur to advantage, let him
flee far from the hills; for the broad pennants of God, even his
clouds, float upon the tops of the hills, and the majesty of God
is most manifest among the hills.&nbsp; Call Gibraltar the hill
of Tarik or Hercules, if you will; but gaze upon it for a moment,
and you will call it the hill of God.&nbsp; Tarik and the old
giant may have built upon it; but not all the dark race of whom
Tarik was one, nor all the giants of old renown of whom the other
was one, could have built up its crags or chiselled the enormous
mass to its present shape.</p>
<p>We dropped anchor not far from the Mole.&nbsp; As we expected
every moment to hear the evening gun, after which no person is
permitted to enter the town, I was in trepidation lest I should
be obliged to pass the night on board the dirty Catalan steamer,
which, as I had no occasion to proceed further in her, I was in
great haste to quit.&nbsp; A boat now drew nigh, with two
individuals at the stern, one of whom, standing up, demanded, in
an authoritative voice, the name of the vessel, her destination,
and cargo.&nbsp; Upon being answered, they came on board.&nbsp;
After some conversation with the captain, they were about to
depart, <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>when I inquired whether I could accompany them on
shore.&nbsp; The person I addressed was a tall young man, with a
fustian frock-coat.&nbsp; He had a long face, long nose, and wide
mouth, with large restless eyes.&nbsp; There was a grin on his
countenance which seemed permanent, and, had it not been for his
bronzed complexion, I should have declared him to be a cockney,
and nothing else.&nbsp; He was, however, no such thing, but what
is called &ldquo;a rock lizard,&rdquo; <a
name="citation301"></a><a href="#footnote301"
class="citation">[301]</a> that is, a person born at Gibraltar of
English parents.&nbsp; Upon hearing my question, which was in
Spanish, he grinned more than ever, and inquired, in a strange
accent, whether I was a son of Gibraltar.&nbsp; I replied that I
had not that honour, but that I was a British subject.&nbsp;
Whereupon he said that he should make no difficulty in taking me
ashore.&nbsp; We entered the boat, which was rapidly rowed toward
the land by four Genoese sailors.&nbsp; My two companions
chattered in their strange Spanish, he of the fustian
occasionally turning his countenance full upon me, the last grin
appearing even more hideous than the preceding ones.&nbsp; We
soon reached the quay, where my name was noted down by a person
who demanded my passport, and I was then permitted to
advance.</p>
<p>It was now dusk, and I lost no time in crossing the drawbridge
and entering the long low archway which, passing under the
rampart, communicates with the town.&nbsp; Beneath this archway
paced, with measured tread, tall red-coated sentinels with
shouldered guns.&nbsp; There was no stopping, no sauntering in
these men.&nbsp; There was no laughter, no exchange of light
conversation with the passers-by, but their bearing was that of
British soldiers, conscious of the duties of their <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>station.&nbsp; What a difference between them and the
listless loiterers who stand at guard at the gate of a Spanish
garrisoned town!</p>
<p>I now proceeded up the principal street, which runs with a
gentle ascent along the base of the hill.&nbsp; Accustomed for
some months past to the melancholy silence of Seville, I was
almost deafened by the noise and bustle which reigned
around.&nbsp; It was Sunday night, and of course no business was
going on, but there were throngs of people passing up and
down.&nbsp; Here was a military guard proceeding along; here
walked a group of officers, there a knot of soldiers stood
talking and laughing.&nbsp; The greater part of the civilians
appeared to be Spaniards, but there was a large sprinkling of
Jews in the dress of those of Barbary, and here and there a
turbaned Moor.&nbsp; There were gangs of sailors likewise,
Genoese, judging from the patois which they were speaking, though
I occasionally distinguished the sound of <i>tou logou sas</i>,
<a name="citation302"></a><a href="#footnote302"
class="citation">[302]</a> by which I knew there were Greeks at
hand, and twice or thrice caught a glimpse of the red cap and
blue silken petticoats of the mariner from the Romaic
isles.&nbsp; On still I hurried, till I arrived at a well-known
hostelry, close by a kind of square, in which stands the little
exchange of Gibraltar.&nbsp; Into this I ran and demanded
lodging, receiving a cheerful welcome from the genius of the
place, who stood behind the bar, and whom I shall perhaps have
occasion subsequently to describe.&nbsp; All the lower rooms were
filled with men of the rock, burly men in general, with swarthy
complexions and English features, with white hats, white jean
jerkins, and white jean pantaloons.&nbsp; They were <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>smoking
pipes and cigars, and drinking porter, wine, and various other
fluids, and conversing in the rock Spanish, or rock English, as
the fit took them.&nbsp; Dense was the smoke of tobacco, and
great the din of voices, and I was glad to hasten upstairs to an
unoccupied apartment, where I was served with some refreshment,
of which I stood much in need.</p>
<p>I was soon disturbed by the sound of martial music close below
my windows.&nbsp; I went down and stood at the door.&nbsp; A
military band was marshalled upon the little square before the
exchange.&nbsp; It was preparing to beat the retreat.&nbsp; After
the prelude, which was admirably executed, the tall leader gave a
flourish with his stick, and strode forward up the street,
followed by the whole company of noble-looking fellows and a
crowd of admiring listeners.&nbsp; The cymbals clashed, the horns
screamed, and the kettle-drum emitted its deep awful note, till
the old rock echoed again, and the hanging terraces of the town
rang with the stirring noise&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dub-a-dub, dub-a-dub&mdash;thus go the
drums,<br />
Tantara, tantara, the Englishman comes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O England! long, long may it be ere the sun of thy glory sink
beneath the wave of darkness!&nbsp; Though gloomy and portentous
clouds are now gathering rapidly around thee, still, still may it
please the Almighty to disperse them, and to grant thee a
futurity longer in duration, and still brighter in renown, than
thy past!&nbsp; Or if thy doom be at hand, may that doom be a
noble one, and worthy of her who has been styled the Old Queen of
the waters!&nbsp; May thou sink, if thou dost sink, amidst blood
and flame, with a mighty noise, causing more than one <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>nation to
participate in thy downfall!&nbsp; Of all fates, may it please
the Lord to preserve thee from a disgraceful and a slow decay;
becoming, ere extinct, a scorn and a mockery for those selfsame
foes who now, though they envy and abhor thee, still fear thee,
nay, even against their will, honour and respect thee!</p>
<p>Arouse thee, whilst yet there is time, and prepare thee for
the combat of life and death!&nbsp; Cast from thee the foul scurf
which now encrusts thy robust limbs, which deadens their force,
and makes them heavy and powerless!&nbsp; Cast from thee thy
false philosophers, who would fain decry what, next to the love
of God, has hitherto been deemed most sacred, the love of the
mother land!&nbsp; Cast from thee thy false patriots, who, under
the pretext of redressing the wrongs of the poor and weak, seek
to promote internal discord, so that thou mayest become only
terrible to thyself!&nbsp; And remove from thee the false
prophets, who have seen vanity and divined lies; who have daubed
thy wall with untempered mortar, that it may fall; who see
visions of peace where there is no peace; who have strengthened
the hands of the wicked, and made the heart of the righteous
sad.&nbsp; Oh, do this, and fear not the result; for either shall
thy end be a majestic and an enviable one, or God shall
perpetuate thy reign upon the waters, thou Old Queen!</p>
<p>The above was part of a broken prayer for my native land,
which, after my usual thanksgiving, I breathed to the Almighty
ere retiring to rest that Sunday night at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been impossible to have chosen a
situation more adapted for studying at my ease Gibraltar and its
inhabitants, than that which I found myself occupying about ten
o&rsquo;clock on the following morning.&nbsp; Seated on a small
bench just opposite the bar, close by the door, in the passage of
the hostelry at which I had taken up my temporary abode, I
enjoyed a view of the square of the exchange and all that was
going on there, and, by merely raising my eyes, could gaze at my
leisure on the stupendous hill which towers above the town to an
altitude of some thousand feet.&nbsp; I could likewise observe
every person who entered or left the house, which is one of great
resort, being situated in the most frequented place of the
principal thoroughfare of the town.&nbsp; My eyes were busy, and
so were my ears.&nbsp; Close beside me stood my excellent friend
Griffiths, the jolly hosteler, of whom I take the present
opportunity of saying a few words, though I <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>dare say he
has been frequently described before, and by far better
pens.&nbsp; Let those who know him not figure to themselves a man
of about fifty, at least six feet in height, and weighing some
eighteen stone, an exceedingly florid countenance and good
features, eyes full of quickness and shrewdness, but at the same
time beaming with good nature.&nbsp; He wears white pantaloons,
white frock, and white hat, and is, indeed, all white, with the
exception of his polished Wellingtons and rubicund face.&nbsp; He
carries a whip beneath his arm, which adds wonderfully to the
knowingness of his appearance, which is rather more that of a
gentleman who keeps an inn on the Newmarket road, &ldquo;purely
for the love of travellers, and the money which they carry about
them,&rdquo; than of a native of the rock.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he
will tell you himself that he is a rock lizard; and you will
scarcely doubt it when, besides his English, which is broad and
vernacular, you hear him speak Spanish, ay, and Genoese too, when
necessary, and it is no child&rsquo;s play to speak the latter,
which I myself could never master.&nbsp; He is a good judge of
horseflesh, and occasionally sells a &ldquo;bit of a
blood,&rdquo; or a Barbary steed, to a young hand, though he has
no objection to do business with an old one; for there is not a
thin, crouching, liver-faced, lynx-eyed Jew of Fez capable of
outwitting him in a bargain, or cheating him out of one single
pound of the fifty thousand sterling which he possesses; and yet
ever bear in mind that he is a good-natured fellow to those who
are disposed to behave honourably to him, and know likewise that
he will lend you money, if you are a gentleman, and are in need
of it; but depend upon it, if he refuse you, there is something
not altogether right <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>about you, for Griffiths knows
<i>his world</i>, and is not to be made a fool of.</p>
<p>There was a prodigious quantity of porter consumed in my
presence during the short hour that I sat on the bench of that
hostelry of the rock.&nbsp; The passage before the bar was
frequently filled with officers, who lounged in for a refreshment
which the sultry heat of the weather rendered necessary, or at
least inviting; whilst not a few came galloping up to the door on
small Barbary horses, which are to be found in great abundance at
Gibraltar.&nbsp; All seemed to be on the best of terms with the
host, with whom they occasionally discussed the merits of
particular steeds, and whose jokes they invariably received with
unbounded approbation.&nbsp; There was much in the demeanour and
appearance of these young men, for the greater part were quite
young, which was highly interesting and agreeable.&nbsp; Indeed,
I believe it may be said of English officers in general, that in
personal appearance, and in polished manners, they bear the palm
from those of the same class over the world.&nbsp; True it is,
that the officers of the royal guard of Russia, especially of the
three noble regiments styled the <i>Priberjensky</i>,
<i>Simeonsky</i>, and <i>Finlansky polks</i>, <a
name="citation307"></a><a href="#footnote307"
class="citation">[307]</a> might fearlessly enter into
competition in almost all points with the flower of the British
army; but it must be remembered, that those regiments are
officered by the choicest specimens of the Sclavonian nobility,
young men selected expressly for the splendour of their persons,
and for the superiority of their mental <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>endowments;
whilst, probably, amongst all the fair-haired Anglo-Saxon youths
whom I now saw gathered near me, there was not a single one of
noble ancestry, nor of proud and haughty name; and certainly, so
far from having been selected to flatter the pride and add to the
pomp of a despot, they had been taken indiscriminately from a
mass of ardent aspirants for military glory, and sent on their
country&rsquo;s service to a remote and unhealthy colony.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, they were such as their country might be proud of,
for gallant boys they looked, with courage on their brows, beauty
and health on their cheeks, and intelligence in their hazel
eyes.</p>
<p>Who is he who now stops before the door without entering, and
addresses a question to my host, who advances with a respectful
salute?&nbsp; He is no common man, or his appearance belies him
strangely.&nbsp; His dress is simple enough; a Spanish hat, with
a peaked crown and broad shadowy brim&mdash;the veritable
<i>sombrero</i>&mdash;jean pantaloons and blue hussar
jacket;&mdash;but how well that dress becomes one of the most
noble-looking figures I ever beheld!&nbsp; I gazed upon him with
strange respect and admiration as he stood benignantly smiling
and joking in good Spanish with an impudent rock rascal, who held
in his hand a huge <i>bogamante</i>, or coarse carrion lobster,
which he would fain have persuaded him to purchase.&nbsp; He was
almost gigantically tall, towering nearly three inches above the
burly host himself, yet athletically symmetrical, and straight as
the pine-tree of Dovrefeld.&nbsp; He must have counted eleven
lustres, which cast an air of mature dignity over a countenance
which seemed to have been chiselled by some Grecian sculptor, and
yet his hair was black as the plume of the Norwegian raven, and
so was the <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>moustache which curled above his well-formed lip.&nbsp;
In the garb of Greece, and in the camp before Troy, I should have
taken him for Agamemnon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that man a
general?&rdquo; said I to a short queer-looking personage, who
sat by my side, intently studying a newspaper.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
gentleman,&rdquo; he whispered in a lisping accent, &ldquo;is,
sir, the Lieutenant-Governor of Gibraltar.&rdquo; <a
name="citation309"></a><a href="#footnote309"
class="citation">[309]</a></p>
<p>On either side outside the door, squatting on the ground, or
leaning indolently against the walls, were some half-dozen men of
very singular appearance.&nbsp; Their principal garment was a
kind of blue gown, something resembling the blouse worn by the
peasants of the north of France, but not so long; it was
compressed around their waists by a leathern girdle, and depended
about halfway down their thighs.&nbsp; Their legs were bare, so
that I had an opportunity of observing the calves, which appeared
unnaturally large.&nbsp; Upon the head they wore small skull-caps
of black wool.&nbsp; I asked the most athletic of these men, a
dark-visaged fellow of forty, who they were.&nbsp; He answered,
<i>hum&aacute;les</i>.&nbsp; This word I knew to be Arabic, in
which tongue it signifies a porter; and, indeed, the next moment,
I saw a similar fellow staggering across the square under an
immense burden, almost sufficient to have broken the back of a
camel.&nbsp; On again addressing my swarthy friend, and inquiring
whence he came, he replied, that he was born at Mogadore, in
Barbary, but had passed the greatest part of his life at
Gibraltar.&nbsp; He added, that he was the <i>capataz</i>, or
head man, of the <i>ham&aacute;les</i> near the door.&nbsp; I now
addressed him in the Arabic of the East, though with scarcely the
hope <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>of
being understood, more especially as he had been so long from his
own country.&nbsp; He, however, answered very pertinently, his
lips quivering with eagerness and his eyes sparkling with joy,
though it was easy to perceive that the Arabic, or rather the
Moorish, was not the language in which he was accustomed either
to think or speak.&nbsp; His companions all gathered round and
listened with avidity, occasionally exclaiming, when anything was
said which they approved of: &ldquo;<i>Wakhud rajil shereef
hada</i>, <i>min beled del scharki</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation310"></a><a href="#footnote310"
class="citation">[310]</a>&nbsp; At last I produced the shekel,
which I invariably carry about me as a pocket-piece, and asked
the <i>capataz</i> whether he had ever seen that money
before.&nbsp; He surveyed the censer and olive-branch for a
considerable time, and evidently knew not what to make of
it.&nbsp; At length he fell to inspecting the characters round
about it on both sides, and giving a cry, exclaimed to the other
<i>ham&aacute;les</i>: &ldquo;Brothers, brothers, these are the
letters of Solomon.&nbsp; This silver is blessed.&nbsp; We must
kiss this money.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then put it upon his head,
pressed it to his eyes, and finally kissed it with enthusiasm, as
did successively all his brethren.&nbsp; Then regaining it, he
returned it to me, with a low reverence.&nbsp; Griffiths
subsequently informed me that the fellow refused to work during
all the rest of the day, and did nothing but smile, laugh, and
talk to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to offer you a glass of bitters, sir,&rdquo;
said the queer-looking personage before mentioned; he was a
corpulent man, very short, and his legs particularly so.&nbsp;
His dress consisted of a greasy snuff-coloured coat, dirty white
trousers, and dirtier stockings.&nbsp; On his head he wore a
rusty silk hat, the eaves of which had a tendency to turn up
before and behind.&nbsp; I <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>had observed that, during my
conversation with the <i>ham&aacute;les</i>, he had several times
uplifted his eyes from the newspaper, and on the production of
the shekel had grinned very significantly, and had inspected it
when in the hand of the <i>capataz</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allow me to
offer you a glass of bitters,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I guessed
you was one of our people before you spoke to the
<i>ham&aacute;les</i>.&nbsp; Sir, it does my heart good to see a
gentleman of your appearance not above speaking to his poor
brethren.&nbsp; It is what I do myself not unfrequently, and I
hope God will blot out my name, and that is Solomons, when I
despise them.&nbsp; I do not pretend to much Arabic myself, yet I
understood you tolerably well, and I liked your discourse
much.&nbsp; You must have a great deal of <i>shillam eidri</i>,
nevertheless you startled me when you asked the
<i>ham&aacute;l</i> if he ever read the <i>Torah</i>; of course
you meant with the <i>meforshim</i>; poor as he is, I do not
believe him <i>becoresh</i> enough to read the <i>Torah</i>
without the commentators.&nbsp; So help me, sir, I believe you to
be a Salamancan Jew; I am told there are still some of the old
families to be found there.&nbsp; Ever at Tudela, sir? not very
far from Salamanca, I believe; one of my own kindred once lived
there: a great traveller, sir, like yourself; went over all the
world to look for the Jews&mdash;went to the top of Sinai.&nbsp;
Anything that I can do for you at Gibraltar, sir?&nbsp; Any
commission? will execute it as reasonably, and more expeditiously
than any one else.&nbsp; My name is Solomons.&nbsp; I am
tolerably well known at Gibraltar; yes, sir, and in the Crooked
Friars, and, for that matter, in the Neuen Stein Steg, <a
name="citation311"></a><a href="#footnote311"
class="citation">[311]</a> at Hamburg; so help me, sir, I think I
once saw your <a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>face at the fair at Bremen.&nbsp; Speak German, sir?
though of course you do.&nbsp; Allow me, sir, to offer you a
glass of bitters.&nbsp; I wish, sir, they were <i>mayim hayim</i>
<a name="citation312a"></a><a href="#footnote312a"
class="citation">[312a]</a> for your sake, I do indeed, sir, I
wish they were living waters.&nbsp; Now, sir, do give me your
opinion as to this matter (lowering his voice and striking the
newspaper).&nbsp; Do you not think it is very hard that one
<i>Yudken</i> should betray the other?&nbsp; When I put my little
secret <i>beyad peluni</i> <a name="citation312b"></a><a
href="#footnote312b" class="citation">[312b]</a>&mdash;you
understand me, sir? when I entrust my poor secret to the custody
of an individual, and that individual a Jew, a <i>Yudken</i>,
sir, I do not wish to be blown, indeed, I do not expect it.&nbsp;
In a word, what do you think of the <i>gold dust robbery</i>, and
what will be done to those unfortunate people, who I see are
convicted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That same day I made inquiry respecting the means of
transferring myself to Tangier, having no wish to prolong my stay
at Gibraltar, where, though it is an exceedingly interesting
place to an observant traveller, I had no particular business to
detain me.&nbsp; In the evening I was visited by a Jew, a native
of Barbary, who informed me that he was secretary to the master
of a small Genoese bark which plied between Tangier and
Gibraltar.&nbsp; Upon his assuring me that the vessel would
infallibly start for the former place on the following evening, I
agreed with him for my passage.&nbsp; He said that as the wind
was blowing from the Levant quarter, the voyage would be a speedy
one.&nbsp; Being desirous now of disposing to the most advantage
of the short time which I expected to remain at Gibraltar, <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>I
determined upon visiting the excavations, which I had as yet
never seen, on the following morning, and accordingly sent for,
and easily obtained, the necessary permission.</p>
<p>About six on Tuesday morning, I started on this expedition,
attended by a very intelligent good-looking lad of the Jewish
persuasion, one of two brothers who officiated at the inn in the
capacity of <i>valets de place</i>.</p>
<p>The morning was dim and hazy, yet sultry to a degree.&nbsp; We
ascended a precipitous street, and, proceeding in an easterly
direction, soon arrived in the vicinity of what is generally
known by the name of the Moorish Castle, a large tower, but so
battered by the cannon balls discharged against it in the famous
siege, that it is at present little better than a ruin.&nbsp;
Hundreds of round holes are to be seen in its sides, in which, as
it is said, the shot are still embedded.&nbsp; Here, at a species
of hut, we were joined by an artillery sergeant, who was to be
our guide.&nbsp; After saluting us, he led the way to a huge
rock, where he unlocked a gate at the entrance of a dark vaulted
passage which passed under it, emerging from which passage we
found ourselves in a steep path, or rather staircase, with walls
on either side.</p>
<p>We proceeded very leisurely, for hurry in such a situation
would have been of little avail, as we should have lost our
breath in a minute&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; The soldier, perfectly
well acquainted with the locality, stalked along with measured
steps, his eyes turned to the ground.</p>
<p>I looked fully as much at that man as at the strange place
where we now were, and which was every moment becoming
stranger.&nbsp; He was a fine specimen of the yeoman turned
soldier; indeed, the <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>corps to which he belonged consists
almost entirely of that class.&nbsp; There he paces along, tall,
strong, ruddy, and chestnut-haired, an Englishman every inch;
behold him pacing along, sober, silent, and civil, a genuine
English soldier.&nbsp; I prize the sturdy Scot, I love the daring
and impetuous Irishman; I admire all the various races which
constitute the population of the British isles; yet I must say
that, upon the whole, none are so well adapted to ply the
soldier&rsquo;s hardy trade as the rural sons of old England, so
strong, so cool, yet, at the same time, animated with so much
hidden fire.&nbsp; Turn to the history of England and you will at
once perceive of what such men are capable: even at Hastings, in
the grey old time, under almost every disadvantage, weakened by a
recent and terrible conflict, without discipline, comparatively
speaking, and uncouthly armed, they all but vanquished the Norman
chivalry.&nbsp; Trace their deeds in France, which they twice
subdued; and even follow them to Spain, where they twanged the
yew and raised the battle-axe, and left behind them a name of
glory at Ingles Mendi, <a name="citation314"></a><a
href="#footnote314" class="citation">[314]</a> a name that shall
last till fire consumes the Cantabrian hills.&nbsp; And, oh, in
modern times, trace the deeds of these gallant men all over the
world, and especially in France and Spain, and admire them, even
as I did that sober, silent, soldier-like man who was showing me
the wonders of a foreign mountain fortress, <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>wrested by
his countrymen from a powerful and proud nation more than a
century before, and of which he was now a trusty and efficient
guardian.</p>
<p>We arrived close to the stupendous precipice, which rises
abruptly above the isthmus called the neutral ground, staring
gauntly and horridly at Spain, and immediately entered the
excavations.&nbsp; They consist of galleries scooped in the
living rock at the distance of some twelve feet from the outside,
behind which they run the whole breadth of the hill in this
direction.&nbsp; In these galleries, at short distances, are
ragged yawning apertures, all formed by the hand of man, where
stand the cannon upon neat slightly raised pavements of small
flint stones, each with its pyramid of bullets on one side, and
on the other a box, in which is stowed the gear which the gunner
requires in the exercise of his craft.&nbsp; Everything was in
its place, everything in the nicest English order, everything
ready to scathe and overwhelm in a few moments the proudest and
most numerous host which might appear marching in hostile array
against this singular fortress on the land side.</p>
<p>There is not much variety in these places, one cavern and one
gun resembling the other.&nbsp; As for the guns, they are not of
large calibre, indeed, such are not needed here, where a pebble
discharged from so great an altitude, would be fraught with
death.&nbsp; On descending a shaft, however, I observed, in one
cave of special importance, two enormous carronades looking with
peculiar wickedness and malignity down a shelving rock, which
perhaps, although not without tremendous difficulty, might be
scaled.&nbsp; The mere wind of one of these huge guns would be
sufficient to topple over a thousand men.&nbsp; What sensations
of <a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>dread
and horror must be awakened in the breast of a foe when this
hollow rock, in the day of siege, emits its flame, smoke, and
thundering wind from a thousand yawning holes; horror not
inferior to that felt by the peasant of the neighbourhood when
Mongibello <a name="citation316"></a><a href="#footnote316"
class="citation">[316]</a> belches forth from all its orifices
its sulphureous fires.</p>
<p>Emerging from the excavations, we proceeded to view various
batteries.&nbsp; I asked the sergeant whether his companions and
himself were dexterous at the use of the guns.&nbsp; He replied
that these cannons were to them what the fowling-piece is to the
fowler, that they handled them as easily, and, he believed,
pointed them with more precision, as they seldom or never missed
an object within range of the shot.&nbsp; This man never spoke
until he was addressed, and then the answers which he gave were
replete with good sense, and in general well worded.&nbsp; After
our excursion, which lasted at least two hours, I made him a
small present, and took leave with a hearty shake of the
hand.</p>
<p>In the evening I prepared to go on board the vessel bound for
Tangier, trusting in what the Jewish secretary had told me as to
its sailing.&nbsp; Meeting him, however, accidentally in the
street, he informed me that it would not start until the
following morning, advising me at the same time to be on board at
an early hour.&nbsp; I now roamed about the streets until night
was beginning to set in, and becoming weary, I was just about to
direct my steps to the inn, when I felt myself gently pulled by
the skirt.&nbsp; I was <a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>amidst a concourse of people who
were gathered around some Irish soldiers who were disputing, and
I paid no attention; but I was pulled again more forcibly than
before, and I heard myself addressed in a language which I had
half forgotten, and which I scarcely expected ever to hear
again.&nbsp; I looked round, and lo! a tall figure stood close to
me and gazed in my face with anxious inquiring eyes.&nbsp; On its
head was the <i>kauk</i> or furred cap of Jerusalem; depending
from its shoulders, and almost trailing on the ground, was a
broad blue mantle, whilst <i>kandrisa</i> or Turkish trousers
enveloped its nether limbs.&nbsp; I gazed on the figure as
wistfully as it gazed upon me.&nbsp; At first the features
appeared perfectly strange, and I was about to exclaim, &ldquo;I
know you not,&rdquo; when one or two lineaments struck me, and I
cried, though somewhat hesitatingly, &ldquo;Surely this is Judah
Lib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was in a steamer in the Baltic in the year &rsquo;34, if I
mistake not.&nbsp; There was a drizzling rain and a high sea,
when I observed a young man of about two and twenty leaning in a
melancholy attitude against the side of the vessel.&nbsp; By his
countenance I knew him to be one of the Hebrew race, nevertheless
there was something very singular in his appearance, something
which is rarely found amongst that people, a certain air of
nobleness which highly interested me.&nbsp; I approached him, and
in a few minutes we were in earnest conversation.&nbsp; He spoke
Polish and Jewish German indiscriminately.&nbsp; The story which
he related to me was highly extraordinary, yet I yielded implicit
credit to all his words, which came from his mouth with an air of
sincerity which precluded doubt; and, moreover, he could have no
motive for deceiving me.&nbsp; One idea, <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>one object,
engrossed him entirely: &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said he, in
language which strongly marked his race, &ldquo;was a native of
Galatia, a Jew of high caste, a learned man, for he knew Zohar,
<a name="citation318"></a><a href="#footnote318"
class="citation">[318]</a> and he was likewise skilled in
medicine.&nbsp; When I was a child of some eight years, he left
Galatia, and taking his wife, who was my mother, and myself with
him, he bent his way unto the East, even to Jerusalem; there he
established himself as a merchant, for he was acquainted with
trade and the arts of getting money.&nbsp; He was much respected
by the Rabbins of Jerusalem, for he was a Polish man, and he knew
more Zohar and more secrets than the wisest of them.&nbsp; He
made frequent journeys, and was absent for weeks and for months,
but he never exceeded six moons.&nbsp; My father loved me, and he
taught me part of what he knew in the moments of his
leisure.&nbsp; I assisted him in his trade, but he took me not
with him in his journeys.&nbsp; We had a shop at Jerusalem, even
a shop <a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>of commerce, where we sold the goods of the Nazarene,
and my mother and myself, and even a little sister who was born
shortly after our arrival at Jerusalem, all assisted my father in
his commerce.&nbsp; At length it came to pass, that on a
particular time he told us that he was going on a journey, and he
embraced us and bade us farewell, and he departed, whilst we
continued at Jerusalem attending to the business.&nbsp; We
awaited his return, but months passed, even six months, and he
came not, and we wondered; and months passed, even other six
passed, but still he came not, nor did we hear any tidings of
him, and our hearts were filled with heaviness and sorrow.&nbsp;
But when years, even two years, were expired, I said to my
mother, &lsquo;I will go and seek my father;&rsquo; and she said,
&lsquo;Do so,&rsquo; and she gave me her blessing, and I kissed
my little sister, and I went forth as far as Egypt, and there I
heard tidings of my father, for people told me he had been there,
and they named the time, and they said that he had passed from
thence to the land of the Turk; so I myself followed to the land
of the Turk, even unto Constantinople.&nbsp; And when I arrived
there I again heard of my father, for he was well known amongst
the Jews, and they told me the time of his being there, and they
added that he had speculated and prospered, and departed from
Constantinople, but whither he went they knew not.&nbsp; So I
reasoned within myself and said, perhaps he may have gone to the
land of his fathers, even unto Galatia, to visit his kindred; so
I determined to go there myself, and I went, and I found our
kindred, and I made myself known to them, and they rejoiced to
see me: but when I asked them for my father, they shook <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>their heads
and could give me no intelligence; and they would fain have had
me tarry with them, but I would not, for the thought of my father
was working strong within me, and I could not rest.&nbsp; So I
departed and went to another country, even unto Russia, and I
went deep into that country, even as far as Kazan, and of all I
met, whether Jew, or Russ, or Tartar, I inquired for my father:
but no one knew him, nor had heard of him.&nbsp; So I turned
back, and here thou seest me; and I now purpose going through all
Germany and France, nay, through all the world, until I have
received intelligence of my father, for I cannot rest until I
know what is become of my father, for the thought of him burneth
in my brain like fire, even like the fire of
<i>Jehinnim</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the individual whom I now saw again, after a lapse of
five years, in the street of Gibraltar, in the dusk of the
evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am Judah,
surnamed the <i>Lib</i>.&nbsp; Thou didst not recognize me, but I
knew thee at once.&nbsp; I should have known thee amongst a
million, and not a day has passed since I last saw thee, but I
have thought on thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was about to reply, but he
pulled me out of the crowd and led me into a shop where, squatted
on the floor, sat six or seven Jews cutting leather; he said
something to them which I did not understand, whereupon they
bowed their heads and followed their occupation, without taking
any notice of us.&nbsp; A singular figure had followed us to the
door: it was a man dressed in exceedingly shabby European
garments, which exhibited nevertheless the cut of a fashionable
tailor.&nbsp; He seemed about fifty; his face, which was very
broad, was of a deep bronze colour; the features were rugged, but
exceedingly <a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>manly, and, notwithstanding they were those of a Jew,
exhibited no marks of cunning, but, on the contrary, much
simplicity and good nature.&nbsp; His form was above the middle
height, and tremendously athletic, the arms and back were
literally those of a Hercules squeezed into a modern surtout; the
lower part of his face was covered with a bushy beard, which
depended halfway down his breast.&nbsp; This figure remained at
the door, his eyes fixed upon myself and Judah.</p>
<p>The first inquiry which I now addressed was, &ldquo;Have you
heard of your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;When we parted,
I proceeded through many lands, and wherever I went I inquired of
the people respecting my father, but still they shook their
heads, until I arrived at the land of Tunis; and there I went to
the head Rabbi, and he told me that he knew my father well, and
that he had been there, even at Tunis, and he named the time, and
he said that from thence he departed for the land of Fez; and he
spoke much of my father and of his learning, and he mentioned the
Zohar, even that dark book which my father loved so well; and he
spoke yet more of my father&rsquo;s wealth and his speculations,
in all of which it seems he had thriven.&nbsp; So I departed, and
I mounted a ship, and I went into the land of Barbary, even unto
Fez, and when I arrived there I heard much intelligence of my
father, but it was intelligence which perhaps was worse than
ignorance.&nbsp; For the Jews told me that my father had been
there, and had speculated and had thriven, and that from thence
he departed for Tafilaltz, which is the country of which the
emperor, even Muley Abderrahman, is a native; and there he was
still prosperous, and his wealth in gold and silver was very <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>great; and
he wished to go to a not far distant town, and he engaged certain
Moors, two in number, to accompany him and defend him and his
treasures: and the Moors were strong men, even <i>makhasniah</i>,
or soldiers; and they made a covenant with my father, and they
gave him their right hands, and they swore to spill their blood
rather than his should be shed.&nbsp; And my father was
encouraged, and he waxed bold, and he departed with them, even
with the two false Moors.&nbsp; And when they arrived in the
uninhabited place, they smote my father, and they prevailed
against him, and they poured out his blood in the way, and they
robbed him of all he had, of his silks and his merchandise, and
of the gold and silver which he had made in his speculations, and
they went to their own village, and there they sat themselves
down and bought lands and houses, and they rejoiced and they
triumphed, and they made a merit of their deed, saying, &lsquo;We
have killed an infidel, even an accursed Jew;&rsquo; and these
things were notorious in Fez.&nbsp; And when I heard these
tidings my heart was sad, and I became like a child, and I wept;
but the fire of <i>Jehinnim</i> burned no longer in my brain, for
I now knew what was become of my father.&nbsp; At last I took
comfort, and I reasoned with myself, saying, &lsquo;Would it not
be wise to go unto the Moorish king and demand of him vengeance
for my father&rsquo;s death, and that the spoilers be despoiled,
and the treasure, even my father&rsquo;s treasure, be wrested
from their hands and delivered up to me who am his
son?&rsquo;&nbsp; And the king of the Moors was not at that time
in Fez, but was absent in his wars; and I arose and followed him,
even unto Arbat, <a name="citation322"></a><a href="#footnote322"
class="citation">[322]</a> which is a seaport, and when I <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>arrived
there, lo! I found him not, but his son was there, and men said
unto me, that to speak unto the son was to speak unto the king,
even Muley Abderrahman; so I went in unto the king&rsquo;s son,
and I kneeled before him, and I lifted up my voice, and I said
unto him what I had to say, and he looked courteously upon me and
said, &lsquo;Truly thy tale is a sorrowful one, and it maketh me
sad; and what thou askest, that will I grant, and thy
father&rsquo;s death shall be avenged, and the spoilers shall be
despoiled; and I will write thee a letter with my own hand unto
the Pasha, even the Pasha of Tafilaltz, and I will enjoin him to
make inquiry into thy matter, and that letter thou shalt thyself
carry and deliver unto him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when I heard these
words, my heart died within my bosom for very fear, and I
replied, &lsquo;Not so, my lord; it is good that thou write a
letter unto the Pasha, even unto the Pasha of Tafilaltz, but that
letter will I not take, neither will I go to Tafilaltz, for no
sooner should I arrive there, and my errand be known, than the
Moors would arise and put me to death, either privily or
publicly, for are not the murderers of my father Moors; and am I
aught but a Jew, though I be a Polish man?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
looked benignantly, and he said, &lsquo;Truly, thou speakest
wisely; I will write the letter, but thou shalt not take it, for
I will send it by other hands; therefore set thy heart at rest,
and doubt not that, if thy tale be true, thy father&rsquo;s death
shall be avenged, and the treasure, or the value thereof, be
recovered and given up to thee; tell me, therefore, where wilt
thou abide till then?&rsquo;&nbsp; And I said unto him, &lsquo;My
lord, I will go into the land of Suz and will tarry
there.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he replied, &lsquo;Do so, and thou shalt
hear speedily from me.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I arose <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>and
departed, and went into the land of Suz, even unto Swirah, which
the Nazarenes call Mogadore; and I waited with a troubled heart
for intelligence from the son of the Moorish king, but no
intelligence came, and never since that day have I heard from
him, and it is now three years since I was in his presence.&nbsp;
And I sat me down at Mogadore, and I married a wife, a daughter
of our nation, and I wrote to my mother, even to Jerusalem, and
she sent me money, and with that I entered into commerce, even as
my father had done, and I speculated, and I was not successful in
my speculations, and I speedily lost all I had.&nbsp; And now I
am come to Gibraltar to speculate on the account of another, a
merchant of Mogadore, but I like not my occupation; he has
deceived me; I am going back, when I shall again seek the
presence of the Moorish king, and demand that the treasure of my
father be taken from the spoilers and delivered up to me, even to
me his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened with mute attention to the singular tale of this
singular man, and when he had concluded I remained a considerable
time without saying a word.&nbsp; At last he inquired what had
brought me to Gibraltar.&nbsp; I told him that I was merely a
passer through on my way to Tangier, for which place I expected
to sail the following morning.&nbsp; Whereupon he observed, that
in the course of a week or two he expected to be there also, when
he hoped that we should meet, as he had much more to tell
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;And peradventure,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you
can afford me counsel which will be profitable, for you are a
person of experience, versed in the ways of many nations; and
when I look in your countenance, heaven seems to open to me, for
I think I see the countenance of a friend, even of a
brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; He <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>then bade me farewell, and departed;
the strange bearded man, who during our conversation had remained
patiently waiting at the door, following him.&nbsp; I remarked
that there was less wildness in his look than on the former
occasion, but, at the same time, more melancholy, and his
features were wrinkled like those of an aged man, though he had
not yet passed the prime of youth.</p>
<h2><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Genoese Mariners&mdash;Saint Michael&rsquo;s
Cave&mdash;Midnight Abysses&mdash;Young American&mdash;A Slave
Proprietor&mdash;The Fairy Man&mdash;Infidelity.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of that night it blew very hard, but, as
the wind was in the Levant quarter, I had no apprehension of
being detained longer at Gibraltar on that account.&nbsp; I went
on board the vessel at an early hour, when I found the crew
engaged in hauling the anchor close, and making other
preparations for sailing.&nbsp; They informed me that we should
probably start in an hour.&nbsp; That time, however, passed, and
we still remained where we were, and the captain continued on
shore.&nbsp; We formed one of a small flotilla of Genoese barks,
the crews of which seemed in their leisure moments to have no
better means of amusing themselves than the exchange of abusive
language: a furious fusilade of this kind presently commenced, in
which the mate of our vessel particularly distinguished himself;
he was a grey-haired Genoese of sixty.&nbsp; Though not able to
speak their patois, I understood much of what was said.&nbsp; It
was truly shocking, and as they shouted it forth, judging from
their violent gestures and distorted features, you would have
concluded them to <a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>be bitter enemies.&nbsp; They were, however, nothing of
the kind, but excellent friends all the time, and indeed very
good-humoured fellows at bottom.&nbsp; Oh, the infirmities of
human nature!&nbsp; When will man learn to become truly
Christian?</p>
<p>I am upon the whole very fond of the Genoese; they have, it is
true, much ribaldry and many vices, but they are a brave and
chivalrous people, and have ever been so, and from them I have
never experienced aught but kindness and hospitality.</p>
<p>After the lapse of another two hours, the Jew secretary
arrived and said something to the old mate, who grumbled much;
then coming up to me, he took off his hat and informed me that we
were not to start that day, saying at the same time that it was a
shame to lose such a noble wind, which would carry us to Tangier
in three hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; said I, and went on
shore.</p>
<p>I now strolled towards St. Michael&rsquo;s cave, in company
with the Jewish lad whom I have before mentioned.</p>
<p>The way thither does not lie in the same direction as that
which leads to the excavations; these confront Spain, whilst the
cave yawns in the face of Africa.&nbsp; It lies nearly at the top
of the mountain, several hundred yards above the sea.&nbsp; We
passed by the public walks, where there are noble trees, and also
by many small houses, situated delightfully in gardens, and
occupied by the officers of the garrison.&nbsp; It is wrong to
suppose Gibraltar a mere naked barren rock; it is not without its
beautiful spots&mdash;spots such as these, looking cool and
refreshing, with bright green foliage.&nbsp; The path soon became
very steep, and we left behind us the dwellings of man.&nbsp; The
<a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>gale of
the preceding night had entirely ceased, and not a breath of air
was stirring; the midday sun shone in all its fierce glory, and
the crags up which we clambered were not unfrequently watered
with the perspiration drops which rained from our temples: at
length we arrived at the cavern.</p>
<p>The mouth is a yawning cleft in the side of the mountain,
about twelve feet high and as many wide; within there is a very
rapid, precipitous descent for some fifty yards, where the cavern
terminates in an abyss which leads to unknown depths.&nbsp; The
most remarkable object is a natural column, which rises up
something like the trunk of an enormous oak, as if for the
purpose of supporting the roof; it stands at a short distance
from the entrance, and gives a certain air of wildness and
singularity to that part of the cavern which is visible, which it
would otherwise not possess.&nbsp; The floor is exceedingly
slippery, consisting of soil which the continual drippings from
the roof have saturated, so that no slight precaution is
necessary for him who treads it.&nbsp; It is very dangerous to
enter this place without a guide well acquainted with it, as,
besides the black pit at the extremity, holes which have never
been fathomed present themselves here and there, falling into
which the adventurer would be dashed to pieces.&nbsp; Whatever
men may please to say of this cave, one thing it seems to tell to
all who approach it, namely, that the hand of man has never been
busy about it.&nbsp; There is many a cave of nature&rsquo;s
forming, old as the earth on which we exist, which nevertheless
exhibits indications that man has turned it to some account, and
that it has been subjected more or less to his modifying
power.&nbsp; Not so this cave of Gibraltar, for, judging from its
appearance, there <a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>is not the slightest reason for supposing that it ever
served for aught else than a den for foul night birds, reptiles,
and beasts of prey.&nbsp; It has been stated by some to have been
used in the days of paganism as a temple to the god Hercules,
who, according to the ancient tradition, raised the singular mass
of crags now called Gibraltar, and the mountain which confronts
it on the African shores, as columns which should say to all
succeeding times that he had been there, and had advanced no
further.&nbsp; Sufficient to observe, that there is nothing
within the cave which would authorize the adoption of such an
opinion, not even a platform on which an altar could have stood,
whilst a narrow path passes before it, leading to the summit of
the mountain.&nbsp; As I have myself never penetrated into its
depths, I can of course not pretend to describe them.&nbsp;
Numerous have been the individuals who, instigated by curiosity,
have ventured down to immense depths, hoping to discover an end,
and indeed scarcely a week passes without similar attempts being
made either by the officers or soldiers of the garrison, all of
which have proved perfectly abortive.&nbsp; No termination has
ever been reached, nor any discoveries made to repay the labour
and frightful danger incurred; precipice succeeds precipice, and
abyss succeeds abyss, in apparently endless succession, with
ledges at intervals, which afford the adventurers opportunities
for resting themselves and affixing their rope-ladders for the
purpose of descending yet further.&nbsp; What is, however, most
mortifying and perplexing, is to observe that these abysses are
not only before, but behind you, and on every side; indeed, close
within the entrance of the cave, on the right, there is a gulf
almost equally dark and full as threatening as that <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>which
exists at the nether end, and perhaps contains within itself as
many gulfs and horrid caverns branching off in all
directions.&nbsp; Indeed, from what I have heard, I have come to
the opinion that the whole hill of Gibraltar is honeycombed, and
I have little doubt that, were it cleft asunder, its interior
would be found full of such abysses of Erebus as those to which
Saint Michael&rsquo;s cave conducts.&nbsp; Many valuable lives
are lost every year in these horrible places; and only a few
weeks before my visit, two sergeants, brothers, had perished in
the gulf on the right hand side of the cave, having, when at a
great depth, slipped down a precipice.&nbsp; The body of one of
these adventurous men is even now rotting in the bowels of the
mountain, preyed upon by its blind and noisome worms; that of his
brother was extricated.&nbsp; Immediately after this horrible
accident, a gate was placed before the mouth of the cave, to
prevent individuals, and especially the reckless soldiers, from
indulging in their extravagant curiosity.&nbsp; The lock,
however, was speedily forced, and at the period of my arrival the
gate swung idly upon its hinges.</p>
<p>As I left the place, I thought that perhaps similar to this
was the cave of Horeb, where dwelt Elijah, when he heard the
still small voice, after the great and strong wind which rent the
mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; the cave
to the entrance of which he went out and stood with his face
wrapped in his mantle, when he heard the voice say unto him,
&ldquo;What doest thou here, Elijah?&rdquo; <a
name="citation330"></a><a href="#footnote330"
class="citation">[330]</a></p>
<p>And what am I doing here, I inquired of myself, as, vexed at
my detention, I descended into the town.</p>
<p><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>That
afternoon I dined in the company of a young American, a native of
South Carolina.&nbsp; I had frequently seen him before, as he had
been staying for some time at the inn previous to my arrival at
Gibraltar.&nbsp; His appearance was remarkable: he was low of
stature, and exceedingly slightly made; his features were pale,
but very well formed; he had a magnificent head of crispy black
hair, and as superb a pair of whiskers of the same colour as I
ever beheld.&nbsp; He wore a white hat, with broad brim and
particularly shallow crown, and was dressed in a light yellow
gingham frock, striped with black, and ample trousers of
calico.&nbsp; In a word, his appearance was altogether queer and
singular.&nbsp; On my return from my ramble to the cave, I found
that he had himself just descended from the mountain, having
since a very early hour been absent exploring its wonders.</p>
<p>A man of the rock asked him how he liked the
excavations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Liked them?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you
might just as well ask a person who has just seen the Niagara
Falls how he liked them&mdash;like is not the word,
mister.&rdquo;&nbsp; The heat was suffocating, as it almost
invariably is in the town of Gibraltar, where rarely a breath of
air is to be felt, as it is sheltered from all winds.&nbsp; This
led another individual to inquire of him whether he did not think
it exceedingly hot?&nbsp; &ldquo;Hot, sir?&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;not at all; fine cotton-gathering weather as a man could
wish for.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t beat it in South Carolina,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You live in South Carolina, sir&mdash;I
hope, sir, you are not a slave proprietor,&rdquo; said the short,
fat Jewish personage in the snuff-coloured coat, who had offered
me the bitters on a previous occasion; &ldquo;it is a terrible
thing to make slaves of poor people, simply because they happen
to be black; <a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>don&rsquo;t you think so, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Think so, sir?&mdash;no, sir, I don&rsquo;t think
so&mdash;I glory in being a slave proprietor; have four hundred
black niggers on my estate&mdash;own estate, sir, near
Charleston&mdash;flog half a dozen of them before breakfast,
merely for exercise.&nbsp; Niggers only made to be flogged, sir;
try to escape sometimes; set the bloodhounds in their trail,
catch them in a twinkling; used to hang themselves
formerly&mdash;the niggers thought that a sure way to return to
their own country and get clear of me; soon put a stop to that;
told them that if any more hanged themselves I&rsquo;d hang
myself too, follow close behind them, and flog them in their own
country ten times worse than in mine.&nbsp; What do you think of
that, friend?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was easy to perceive that there was
more of fun than malice in this eccentric little fellow, for his
large grey eyes were sparkling with good humour whilst he poured
out these wild things.&nbsp; He was exceedingly free of his
money; and a dirty Irish woman, a soldier&rsquo;s wife, having
entered with a basketful of small boxes and trinkets, made of
portions of the rock of Gibraltar, he purchased the greater part
of her ware, giving her for every article the price (by no means
inconsiderable) which she demanded.&nbsp; He had glanced at me
several times, and at last I saw him stoop down and whisper
something to the Jew, who replied in an undertone, though with
considerable earnestness, &ldquo;Oh dear no, sir; perfectly
mistaken, sir; is no American, sir; from Salamanca, sir&mdash;the
gentleman is a Salamancan Spaniard.&rdquo;&nbsp; The waiter at
length informed us that he had laid the table, and that perhaps
it would be agreeable to us to dine together: we instantly
assented.&nbsp; I found my new acquaintance in many respects a
most agreeable companion: he soon told me his history.&nbsp; <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>He was a
planter, and, from what he hinted, just come to his
property.&nbsp; He was part owner of a large vessel which traded
between Charleston and Gibraltar, and the yellow fever having
just broken out at the former place, he had determined to take a
trip (his first) to Europe in this ship; having, as he said,
already visited every state in the Union, and seen all that was
to be seen there.&nbsp; He described to me, in a very na&iuml;ve
and original manner, his sensations on passing by Tarifa, which
was the first walled town he had ever seen.&nbsp; I related to
him the history of that place, to which he listened with great
attention.&nbsp; He made divers attempts to learn from me who I
was, all of which I evaded, though he seemed fully convinced that
I was an American; and, amongst other things, asked me whether my
father had not been American consul at Seville.&nbsp; What,
however, most perplexed him was my understanding Moorish and
Gaelic, which he had heard me speak respectively to the
<i>ham&aacute;les</i> and the Irish woman, the latter of whom, as
he said, had told him that I was a fairy man.&nbsp; At last he
introduced the subject of religion, and spoke with much contempt
of revelation, avowing himself a deist: he was evidently very
anxious to hear my opinion, but here again I evaded him, and
contented myself with asking him whether he had ever read the
Bible.&nbsp; He said he had not, but that he was well acquainted
with the writings of Volney and Mirabeau.&nbsp; I made no answer,
whereupon he added, that it was by no means his habit to
introduce such subjects, and that there were very few persons to
whom he would speak so unreservedly, but that I had very much
interested him, though our acquaintance had been short.&nbsp; I
replied, that he would scarcely have spoken at Boston in the <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>manner that
I had just heard him, and that it was easy to perceive that he
was not a New Englander.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I should as little have thought of speaking so at
Charleston, for if I held such conversation there, I should soon
have had to speak to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had I known less of deists than it has been my fortune to
know, I should perhaps have endeavoured to convince this young
man of the erroneousness of the ideas which he had adopted; but I
was aware of all that he would have urged in reply, and, as the
believer has no carnal arguments to address to carnal reason upon
this subject, I thought it best to avoid disputation, which I
felt sure would lead to no profitable result.&nbsp; Faith is the
free gift of God, and I do not believe that ever yet was an
infidel converted by means of after-dinner polemics.&nbsp; This
was the last evening of my sojourn in Gibraltar.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Again on Board&mdash;The Strange
Visage&mdash;The Haji&mdash;Setting Sail&mdash;The Two
Jews&mdash;American Vessel&mdash;Tangier&mdash;Adun
Oulem&mdash;The Struggle&mdash;The Forbidden Thing.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the 8th of August, I was again on board the
Genoese bark, at as early an hour as on the previous
morning.&nbsp; After waiting, however, two or three hours without
any preparation being made for departing, I was about to return
to the shore once more, but the old Genoese mate advised me to
stay, assuring me that he had no doubt of our sailing speedily,
as all the cargo was on board, and we had nothing further to
detain us.&nbsp; I was reposing myself in the little cabin, when
I heard a boat strike against the side of the vessel, and some
people come on board.&nbsp; Presently a face peered in at the
opening, strange and wild.&nbsp; I was half asleep, and at first
imagined I was dreaming, for the face seemed more like that of a
goat or an ogre than of a human being; its long beard almost
touching my face as I lay extended in a kind of berth.&nbsp;
Starting up, however, I recognized the singular-looking Jew whom
I had seen in the company of Judah Lib.&nbsp; He recognized me
also, and nodding, bent his huge features into a smile.&nbsp; I
arose and went upon deck, <a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>where I found him in company with
another Jew, a young man in the dress of Barbary.&nbsp; They had
just arrived in the boat.&nbsp; I asked my friend of the beard
who he was, from whence he came, and where he was going?&nbsp; He
answered, in broken Portuguese, that he was returning from
Lisbon, where he had been on business, to Mogadore, of which
place he was a native.&nbsp; He then looked me in the face and
smiled, and taking out a book from his pocket, in Hebrew
characters, fell to reading it; whereupon a Spanish sailor on
board observed that with such a beard and book he must needs be a
<i>sabio</i>, or sage.&nbsp; His companion was from Mequinez, and
spoke only Arabic.</p>
<p>A large boat now drew nigh, the stern of which was filled with
Moors; there might be about twelve, and the greater part
evidently consisted of persons of distinction, as they were
dressed in all the pomp and gallantry of the East, with
snow-white turbans, <i>jabadores</i> of green silk or scarlet
cloth, and <i>bedeyas</i> rich with gold galloon.&nbsp; Some of
them were exceedingly fine men, and two amongst them, youths,
were strikingly handsome, and, so far from exhibiting the dark
swarthy countenance of Moors in general, their complexions were
of a delicate red and white.&nbsp; The principal personage, and
to whom all the rest paid much deference, was a tall athletic man
of about forty.&nbsp; He wore a vest of white quilted cotton, and
white <i>kandrisa</i>, whilst gracefully wound round his body,
and swathing the upper part of his head, was the <i>haik</i>, or
white flannel wrapping plaid, always held in so much estimation
by the Moors from the earliest period of their history.&nbsp; His
legs were bare, and his feet only protected from the ground by <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>yellow
slippers.&nbsp; He displayed no further ornament than one large
gold earring, from which depended a pearl, evidently of great
price.&nbsp; A noble black beard, about a foot in length, touched
his muscular breast.&nbsp; His features were good, with the
exception of the eyes, which were somewhat small; their
expression, however, was evil; their glances were sullen; and
malignity and ill-nature were painted in every lineament of his
countenance, which seemed never to have been brightened with a
smile.&nbsp; The Spanish sailor, of whom I have already had
occasion to speak, informed me in a whisper, that he was a
<i>santurron</i>, <a name="citation337"></a><a
href="#footnote337" class="citation">[337]</a> or big saint, and
was so far back on his way from Mecca, adding, that he was a
merchant of immense wealth.&nbsp; It soon appeared that the other
Moors had merely attended him on board through friendly
politeness, as they all successively came to bid him adieu, with
the exception of two blacks, who were his attendants.&nbsp; I
observed that these blacks, when the Moors presented them their
hands at departing, invariably made an effort to press them to
their lips, which effort was as uniformly foiled, the Moors in
every instance, by a speedy and graceful movement, drawing back
their hand locked in that of the black, which they pressed
against their own heart; as much as to say, &ldquo;though a negro
and a slave you are a Moslem, and being so, you are our
brother&mdash;Allah knows no distinctions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
boatman now went up to the <i>haji</i>, demanding payment,
stating, at the same time, that he had been on board three times
on his account, conveying his luggage.&nbsp; The sum which he
demanded appeared <a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>exorbitant to the <i>haji</i>, who, forgetting that he
was a saint, and fresh from Mecca, fumed outrageously, and in
broken Spanish called the boatman thief.&nbsp; If there be any
term of reproach which stings a Spaniard (and such was the
boatman) more than another, it is that one; and the fellow no
sooner heard it applied to himself, than, with eyes sparkling
with fury, he put his fist to the <i>haji&rsquo;s</i> nose, and
repaid the one opprobrious name by at least ten others equally
bad or worse.&nbsp; He would perhaps have proceeded to acts of
violence had he not been pulled away by the other Moors, who led
him aside, and I suppose either said or gave him something which
pacified him, as he soon got into his boat, and returned with
them on shore.&nbsp; The captain now arrived with his Jewish
secretary, and orders were given for setting sail.</p>
<p>At a little past twelve we were steering out of the bay of
Gibraltar.&nbsp; The wind was in the right quarter, but for some
time we did not make much progress, lying almost becalmed beneath
the lee of the hill; by degrees, however, our progress became
brisker, and in about an hour we found ourselves careering
smartly towards Tarifa.</p>
<p>The Jew secretary stood at the helm, and indeed appeared to be
the person who commanded the vessel, and who issued out all the
necessary orders, which were executed under the superintendence
of the old Genoese mate.&nbsp; I now put some questions to the
<i>haji</i>, but he looked at me askance with his sullen eye,
pouted with his lip, and remained silent; as much as to say,
&ldquo;Speak not to me, I am holier than thou.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
found his negroes, however, far more conversable.&nbsp; One of
them was old and ugly, the other about twenty, <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>and as
well-looking as it is possible for a negro to be.&nbsp; His
colour was perfect ebony, his features exceedingly well-formed
and delicate, with the exception of the lips, which were too
full.&nbsp; The shape of his eyes was peculiar; they were rather
oblong than round, like those of an Egyptian figure.&nbsp; Their
expression was thoughtful and meditative.&nbsp; In every respect
he differed from his companion, even in colour (though both were
negroes), and was evidently a scion of some little-known and
superior race.&nbsp; As he sat beneath the mast gazing at the
sea, I thought he was misplaced, and that he would have appeared
to more advantage amidst boundless sands, and beneath a
date-tree, and then he might have well represented a
<i>Jin</i>.&nbsp; I asked him from whence he came; he replied
that he was a native of Fez, but that he had never known his
parents.&nbsp; He had been brought up, he added, in the family of
his present master, whom he had followed in the greater part of
his travels, and with whom he had thrice visited Mecca.&nbsp; I
asked him if he liked being a slave?&nbsp; Whereupon he replied,
that he was a slave no longer, having been made free for some
time past, on account of his faithful services, as had likewise
his companion.&nbsp; He would have told me much more, but the
<i>haji</i> called him away, and otherwise employed him, probably
to prevent his being contaminated by me.</p>
<p>Thus, avoided by the Moslems, I betook myself to the Jews,
whom I found nowise backward in cultivating an intimacy.&nbsp;
The sage of the beard told me his history, which in some respects
reminded me of that of Judah Lib, as it seemed that, a year or
two previous, he had quitted Mogadore in pursuit of his son, who
had betaken himself to Portugal.&nbsp; On the <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>arrival,
however, of the father at Lisbon, he discovered that the fugitive
had, a few days before, shipped himself for the Brazils.&nbsp;
Unlike Judah in quest of his father, he now became weary, and
discontinued the pursuit.&nbsp; The younger Jew from Mequinez was
exceedingly gay and lively as soon as he perceived that I was
capable of understanding him, and made me smile by his humorous
account of Christian life, as he had observed it at Gibraltar,
where he had made a stay of about a month.&nbsp; He then spoke of
Mequinez, which, he said, was a <i>Jennut</i>, or Paradise,
compared with which Gibraltar was a sty of hogs.&nbsp; So great,
so universal is the love of country.&nbsp; I soon saw that both
these people believed me to be of their own nation: indeed, the
young one, who was much the most familiar, taxed me with being
so, and spoke of the infamy of denying my own blood.&nbsp;
Shortly before our arrival off Tarifa, universal hunger seemed to
prevail amongst us.&nbsp; The <i>haji</i> and his negroes
produced their store, and feasted on roast fowls, the Jews ate
grapes and bread, myself bread and cheese, whilst the crew
prepared a mess of anchovies.&nbsp; Two of them speedily came
with a large portion, which they presented to me with the
kindness of brothers: I made no hesitation in accepting their
present, and found the anchovies delicious.&nbsp; As I sat
between the Jews, I offered them some, but they turned away their
heads with disgust, and cried, <i>Haloof</i>.&nbsp; They at the
same time, however, shook me by the hand, and, uninvited, took a
small portion of my bread.&nbsp; I had a bottle of Cognac, which
I had brought with me as a preventive to sea-sickness, and I
presented it to them; but this they also refused, exclaiming,
<i>Har&aacute;m</i>.&nbsp; I said nothing.</p>
<p><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>We
were now close to the lighthouse of Tarifa, and turning the head
of the bark towards the west, we made directly for the coast of
Africa.&nbsp; The wind was now blowing very fresh, and as we had
it almost in our poop, we sprang along at a tremendous rate, the
huge latine sails threatening every moment to drive us beneath
the billows, which an adverse tide raised up against us.&nbsp;
Whilst scudding along in this manner, we passed close under the
stern of a large vessel bearing American colours; she was tacking
up the straits, and slowly winning her way against the impetuous
Levanter.&nbsp; As we passed under her, I observed the poop
crowded with people gazing at us; indeed, we must have offered a
singular spectacle to those on board, who, like my young American
friend at Gibraltar, were visiting the Old World for the first
time.&nbsp; At the helm stood the Jew; his whole figure enveloped
in a gabardine, the cowl of which, raised above his head, gave
him almost the appearance of a spectre in its shroud; whilst upon
the deck, mixed with Europeans in various kinds of dresses, all
of them picturesque with the exception of my own, trod the
turbaned Moors, the <i>haik</i> of the <i>haji</i> flapping
loosely in the wind.&nbsp; The view they obtained of us, however,
could have been but momentary, as we bounded past them literally
with the speed of a racehorse, so that in about an hour&rsquo;s
time we were not more than a mile&rsquo;s distance from the
foreland on which stands the fortress Almin&agrave;r, and which
constitutes the boundary point of the bay of Tangier towards the
east.&nbsp; There the wind dropped and our progress was again
slow.</p>
<p>For a considerable time Tangier had appeared in sight.&nbsp;
Shortly after standing away from Tarifa, we had descried it in
the far distance, when it showed <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>like a white dove brooding on its
nest.&nbsp; The sun was setting behind the town when we dropped
anchor in its harbour, amidst half a dozen barks and felouks
about the size of our own, the only vessels which we saw.&nbsp;
There stood Tangier before us, and a picturesque town it was,
occupying the sides and top of two hills, one of which, bold and
bluff, projects into the sea where the coast takes a sudden and
abrupt turn.&nbsp; Frowning and battlemented were its walls,
either perched on the top of precipitous rocks, whose base was
washed by the salt billows, or rising from the narrow strand
which separates the hill from the ocean.</p>
<p>Yonder are two or three tiers of batteries, displaying heavy
guns, which command the harbour; above them you see the terraces
of the town rising in succession like steps for giants.&nbsp; But
all is white, perfectly white, so that the whole seems cut out of
an immense chalk rock, though true it is that you behold here and
there tall green trees springing up from amidst the whiteness:
perhaps they belong to Moorish gardens, and beneath them even now
peradventure is reclining many a dark-eyed Leila, akin to the
<i>houris</i>.&nbsp; Right before you is a high tower, or
minaret, not white but curiously painted, which belongs to the
principal mosque of Tangier; a black banner waves upon it, for it
is the feast of Ashor.&nbsp; A noble beach of white sand fringes
the bay from the town to the foreland of Almin&agrave;r.&nbsp; To
the east rise prodigious hills and mountains: they are Gibil Muza
and his chain; and yon tall fellow is the peak of Tetuan; the
grey mists of evening are enveloping their sides.&nbsp; Such was
Tangier, such its vicinity, as it appeared to me whilst gazing
from the Genoese bark.</p>
<p>A boat was now lowered from the vessel, in which <a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>the
captain, who was charged with the mail from Gibraltar, the Jew
secretary, and the <i>haji</i> and his attendant negroes departed
for the shore.&nbsp; I would have gone with them, but I was told
that I could not land that night, as ere my passport and bill of
health could be examined, the gates would be closed; so I
remained on board with the crew and the two Jews.&nbsp; The
former prepared their supper, which consisted simply of pickled
<i>tomates</i>, <a name="citation343a"></a><a
href="#footnote343a" class="citation">[343a]</a> the other
provisions having been consumed.&nbsp; The old Genoese brought me
a portion, apologizing at the same time for the plainness of the
fare.&nbsp; I accepted it with thanks, and told him that a
million better men than myself had a worse supper.&nbsp; I never
ate with more appetite.&nbsp; As the night advanced, the Jews
sang Hebrew hymns, and when they had concluded, demanded of me
why I was silent, so I lifted up my voice and chanted <i>Adun
Oulem</i>. <a name="citation343b"></a><a href="#footnote343b"
class="citation">[343b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>Darkness had now fallen over land and sea: not a sound
was heard save occasionally the distant barking of a dog from the
shore, or some plaintive Genoese ditty, which arose from a
neighbouring bark.&nbsp; The town seemed buried in silence and
gloom, no light, not even that of a taper, could be
descried.&nbsp; Turning our eyes in the direction of Spain,
however, we perceived a magnificent conflagration, seemingly
enveloping the side and head of one of the lofty mountains
northward of Tarifa.&nbsp; The blaze was redly reflected in the
waters of the strait; either the brushwood was burning or the
<i>carboneros</i> were plying their dusky toil.&nbsp; The Jews
now complained of weariness, and the younger, uncording a small
mattress, spread it on the deck and sought repose.&nbsp; The sage
descended into the cabin, but he had scarcely time to lie down
ere the old mate, darting forward, dived in after him, and pulled
him out by the heels, for it was very shallow, and the descent
was effected by not more than two or three steps.&nbsp; After
accomplishing this, he called him many opprobrious names, and
threatened him with his foot, as he lay sprawling on the
deck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who are a
dog and a Jew, and pay as a dog and a Jew; think you to sleep in
the cabin?&nbsp; Undeceive yourself, beast: that cabin shall be
slept in by none to-night but this Christian
<i>caballero</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sage made no reply, but arose
from the deck and stroked his beard, whilst the old Genoese
proceeded in his Philippic.&nbsp; Had the Jew been disposed, he
could have strangled the insulter in a moment, or crushed him to
death in his brawny arms, as I never remember to have seen a
figure so powerful and muscular; but he was evidently slow <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>to anger,
and long-suffering.&nbsp; Not a resentful word escaped him, and
his features retained their usual expression of benignant
placidity.</p>
<p>I now assured the mate that I had not the slightest objection
to the Jew&rsquo;s sharing the cabin with me, but rather wished
it, as there was room for us both and for more.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Excuse me, Sir Cavalier,&rdquo; replied the Genoese,
&ldquo;but I swear to permit no such thing; you are young, and do
not know this <i>canaille</i> as I do, who have been backward and
forward to this coast for twenty years.&nbsp; If the beast is
cold, let him sleep below the hatches as I and the rest shall,
but that cabin he shall not enter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observing that he
was obstinate, I retired, and in a few minutes was in a sound
sleep, which lasted till daybreak.&nbsp; Twice or thrice, indeed,
I thought that a struggle was taking place near me; but I was so
overpowered with weariness, or &ldquo;sleep drunken,&rdquo; as
the Germans call it, that I was unable to arouse myself
sufficiently to discover what was going on.&nbsp; The truth is,
that three times during the night, the sage, feeling himself
uncomfortable in the open air by the side of his companion,
penetrated into the cabin, and was as many times dragged out by
his relentless old enemy, who, suspecting his intentions, kept
his eye upon him throughout the night.</p>
<p>About five I arose: the sun was shining brightly and
gloriously upon town, bay, and mountain; the crew were already
employed upon deck repairing a sail which had been shivered in
the wind of the preceding day.&nbsp; The Jews sat disconsolate on
the poop; they complained much of the cold they had suffered in
their exposed situation.&nbsp; Over the left eye of the sage I
observed a bloody cut, which he <a name="page346"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 346</span>informed me he had received from the
old Genoese after he had dragged him out of the cabin for the
last time.&nbsp; I now produced my bottle of Cognac, begging that
the crew would partake of it as a slight return for their
hospitality.&nbsp; They thanked me, and the bottle went its
round; it was last in the hands of the old mate, who, after
looking for a moment at the sage, raised it to his mouth, where
he kept it a considerable time longer than any of his companions,
after which he returned it to me with a low bow.&nbsp; The sage
now inquired what the bottle contained.&nbsp; I told him Cognac,
or <i>aguardiente</i>, whereupon with some eagerness he begged
that I would allow him to take a draught.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is
this?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;yesterday you told me that it was a
forbidden thing, an abomination.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was not aware that it
was brandy; I thought it was wine, which assuredly is an
abomination, and a forbidden thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
forbidden in the <i>Torah</i>?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it forbidden in the law of God?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
not,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but one thing I know, that the sages
have forbidden it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sages like
yourself,&rdquo; cried I with warmth; &ldquo;sages like yourself,
with long beards and short understandings; the use of both drinks
is permitted, but more danger lurks in this bottle than in a tun
of wine.&nbsp; Well said my Lord the Nazarene, &lsquo;ye strain
at a gnat, and swallow a camel;&rsquo; but as you are cold and
shivering, take the bottle and revive yourself with a small
portion of its contents.&rdquo;&nbsp; He put it to his lips and
found not a single drop.&nbsp; The old Genoese grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bestia</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I saw by your
looks that you wished to drink of that bottle, and I said within
me, even though I suffocate, yet will I not leave one drop <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>of the
<i>aguardiente</i> of the Christian Cavalier to be wasted on that
Jew, on whose head may evil lightnings fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sir Cavalier,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you can
go ashore: these two sailors shall row you to the Mole, and
convey your baggage where you think proper; may the Virgin bless
you wherever you go.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm">The Mole&mdash;The Two Moors&mdash;Djmah of
Tangier&mdash;House of God&mdash;British Consul&mdash;Curious
Spectacle&mdash;The Moorish House&mdash;Joanna Correa&mdash;Ave
Maria.</p>
<p>So we rowed to the Mole, and landed.&nbsp; This Mole consists
at present of nothing more than an immense number of large loose
stones, which run about five hundred yards into the bay; they are
part of the ruins of a magnificent pier which the English, who
were the last foreign nation which held Tangier, destroyed when
they evacuated the place. <a name="citation348"></a><a
href="#footnote348" class="citation">[348]</a>&nbsp; The Moors
have never attempted to repair it: the surf at high water breaks
over it with great fury.&nbsp; I found it a difficult task to
pick my way over the slippery stones, and should once or twice
have fallen but for the kindness of the Genoese mariners.&nbsp;
At last we reached the beach, and were proceeding towards the
gate of the town, when two persons, Moors, came up to us.&nbsp; I
almost started at sight of the first: he was a huge old barbarian
with a white uncombed beard, dirty turban, <i>haik</i>, and
trousers, naked legs, and immense splay feet, the heels of which
stood out a couple of inches at least behind his rusty black
slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the captain of the port,&rdquo; said one of the
<a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>Genoese;
&ldquo;pay him respect.&rdquo;&nbsp; I accordingly doffed my hat
and cried, &ldquo;<i>Sba alkheir a sidi</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation349"></a><a href="#footnote349"
class="citation">[349]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
Englishmans?&rdquo; shouted the old grisly giant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Englishmans, my lord,&rdquo; I replied, and, advancing,
presented him my hand, which he nearly wrung off with his
tremendous gripe.&nbsp; The other Moor now addressed me in a
jargon composed of English, Spanish, and Arabic.&nbsp; A
queer-looking personage was he also, but very different in most
respects from his companion, being shorter by a head at least,
and less complete by one eye, for the left orb of vision was
closed, leaving him, as the Spaniards style it, <i>tuerto</i>;
he, however, far outshone the other in cleanliness of turban,
<i>haik</i>, and trousers.&nbsp; From what he jabbered to me, I
collected that he was the English consul&rsquo;s <i>mahasni</i>,
or soldier; that the consul, being aware of my arrival, had
despatched him to conduct me to his house.&nbsp; He then motioned
me to follow him, which I did, the old port-captain attending us
to the gate, when he turned aside into a building, which I judged
to be a kind of custom-house from the bales and boxes of every
description piled up before it.&nbsp; We passed the gate and
proceeded up a steep and winding ascent.&nbsp; On our left was a
battery full of guns, pointing to the sea, and on our right a
massive wall, seemingly in part cut out of the hill: a little
higher up we arrived at an opening where stood the mosque which I
have already mentioned.&nbsp; As I gazed upon the tower I said to
myself, &ldquo;Surely we have here a younger sister of the
Giralda of Seville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know not whether the resemblance between the two edifices
has been observed by any other individual; and perhaps there are
those who would assert <a name="page350"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>that no resemblance exists,
especially if, in forming an opinion, they were much swayed by
size and colour: the hue of the Giralda is red, or rather
vermilion, whilst that which predominates in the Djmah of Tangier
is green, the bricks of which it is built being of that colour;
though between them, at certain intervals, are placed others of a
light red tinge, so that the tower is beautifully
variegated.&nbsp; With respect to size, standing beside the giant
witch of Seville, the Tangerine Djmah would show like a ten-year
sapling in the vicinity of the cedar of Lebanon, whose trunk the
tempests of five hundred years have worn.&nbsp; And yet I will
assert that the towers in other respects are one and the same,
and that the same mind and the same design are manifested in
both; the same shape do they exhibit, and the same marks have
they on their walls, even those mysterious arches graven on the
superfice of the bricks, emblematic of I know not what.&nbsp; The
two structures may, without any violence, be said to stand in the
same relation to each other as the ancient and modern
Moors.&nbsp; The Giralda is the world&rsquo;s wonder, and the old
Moor was all but the world&rsquo;s conqueror.&nbsp; The modern
Moor is scarcely known, and who ever heard of the tower of
Tangier?&nbsp; Yet examine it attentively, and you will find in
that tower much, very much, to admire, and certainly, if
opportunity enable you to consider the modern Moor minutely, you
will discover in him, and in his actions, amongst much that is
wild, uncouth, and barbarous, not a little capable of amply
rewarding laborious investigation.</p>
<p>As we passed the mosque I stopped for a moment before the
door, and looked in upon the interior: I saw nothing but a
quadrangular court paved with <a name="page351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>painted tiles and exposed to the
sky; on all sides were arched <i>piazzas</i>, and in the middle
was a fountain, at which several Moors were performing their
ablutions.&nbsp; I looked around for the abominable thing and
found it not; the besetting sin of the pseudo-Christian Church
did not stare me in the face in every corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Papist, and take a lesson; here is a
house of God, in externals at least, such as a house of God
should be: four walls, a fountain, and the eternal firmament
above, which mirrors His glory.&nbsp; Dost thou build such houses
to the God who has said, &lsquo;Thou shalt make to thyself no
graven image&rsquo;?&nbsp; Fool, thy walls are stuck with idols;
thou callest a stone thy Father, and a piece of rotting wood the
Queen of Heaven.&nbsp; Fool, thou knowest not even the Ancient of
Days, and the very Moor can instruct thee.&nbsp; He at least
knows the Ancient of Days who has said, &lsquo;Thou shalt have no
other gods but me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as I said these words I heard a cry like the roaring of a
lion, and an awful voice in the distance exclaim, &ldquo;<i>Kapul
Udbagh</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation351"></a><a
href="#footnote351" class="citation">[351]</a></p>
<p>We now turned to the left through a passage which passed under
the tower, and had scarcely proceeded a few steps, when I heard a
prodigious hubbub of infantine voices: I listened for a moment,
and distinguished verses of the Koran; it was a school.&nbsp;
Another lesson for thee, Papist.&nbsp; Thou callest thyself a
Christian, yet the book of Christ thou persecutest; thou huntest
it even to the seashore, compelling it to seek refuge upon the
billows of the sea.&nbsp; Fool, learn a lesson from the Moor, who
teaches his child to repeat with its first accents the most
important portions of the book of his law, and considers <a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>himself
wise or foolish, according as he is versed in or ignorant of that
book; whilst thou, blind slave, knowest not what the book of thy
own law contains, nor wishest to know: yet art thou not to be
judged by thy own law?&nbsp; Idol-monger, learn consistency from
the Moor: he says that he shall be judged after his own law, and
therefore he prizes and gets by heart the entire book of his
law.</p>
<p>We were now at the consul&rsquo;s house, a large roomy
habitation, built in the English style.&nbsp; The soldier led me
through a court into a large hall hung with the skins of all
kinds of ferocious animals, from the kingly lion to the snarling
jackal.&nbsp; Here I was received by a Jew domestic, who
conducted me at once to the consul, who was in his library.&nbsp;
He received me with the utmost frankness and genuine kindness,
and informed me that, having received a letter from his excellent
friend Mr. B---, in which I was strongly recommended, he had
already engaged me a lodging in the house of a Spanish woman, who
was, however, a British subject, and with whom he believed that I
should find myself as comfortable as it was possible to be in
such a place as Tangier.&nbsp; He then inquired if I had any
particular motive for visiting the place, and I informed him
without hesitation that I came with the intention of distributing
a certain number of copies of the New Testament in the Spanish
language amongst the Christian residents of the place.&nbsp; He
smiled, and advised me to proceed with considerable caution,
which I promised to do.&nbsp; We then discoursed on other
subjects, and it was not long before I perceived that I was in
the company of a most accomplished scholar, especially in the
Greek and Latin classics; he appeared likewise to be thoroughly
<a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>acquainted with the Barbary empire and with the Moorish
character.</p>
<p>After half an hour&rsquo;s conversation, exceedingly agreeable
and instructive to myself, I expressed a wish to proceed to my
lodging; whereupon he rang the bell, and, the same Jewish
domestic entering who had introduced me, he said to him in the
English language, &ldquo;Take this gentleman to the house of
Joanna Correa, the Mahonese widow, and enjoin her, in my name, to
take care of him and attend to his comforts; by doing which she
will confirm me in the good opinion which I at present entertain
of her, and will increase my disposition to befriend
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, attended by the Jew, I now bent my steps to the lodging
prepared for me.&nbsp; Having ascended the street in which the
house of the consul was situated, we entered a small square which
stands about half way up the hill.&nbsp; This, my companion
informed me, was the <i>soc</i>, or market-place.&nbsp; A curious
spectacle here presented itself.&nbsp; All round the square were
small wooden booths, which very much resembled large boxes turned
on their sides, the lid being supported above by a string.&nbsp;
Before each of these boxes was a species of counter, or rather
one long counter ran in front of the whole line, upon which were
raisins, dates, and small barrels of sugar, soap, and butter, and
various other articles.&nbsp; Within each box, in front of the
counter, and about three feet from the ground, sat a human being,
with a blanket on its shoulders, a dirty turban on its head, and
ragged trousers, which descended as far as the knee, though in
some instances, I believe, these were entirely dispensed
with.&nbsp; In its hand it held a stick, to the end of which was
affixed a bunch of palm <a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>leaves, which it waved incessantly
as a fan, for the purpose of scaring from its goods the million
flies which, engendered by the Barbary sun, endeavoured to settle
upon them.&nbsp; Behind it, and on either side, were piles of the
same kind of goods.&nbsp; <i>Shrit hinai</i>, <i>shrit hinai</i>,
<a name="citation354"></a><a href="#footnote354"
class="citation">[354]</a> was continually proceeding from its
mouth.&nbsp; Such are the grocers of Tangier, such their
shops.</p>
<p>In the middle of the <i>soc</i>, upon the stones, were
pyramids of melons and <i>sandias</i>, and also baskets filled
with other kinds of fruit, exposed for sale, whilst round cakes
of bread were lying here and there upon the stones, beside which
sat on their hams the wildest-looking beings that the most
extravagant imagination ever conceived, the head covered with an
enormous straw hat, at least two yards in circumference, the
eaves of which, flapping down, completely concealed the face,
whilst the form was swathed in a blanket, from which occasionally
were thrust skinny arms and fingers.&nbsp; These were Moorish
women, who were, I believe, in all instances, old and ugly,
judging from the countenances of which I caught a glimpse as they
lifted the eaves of their hats to gaze on me as I passed, or to
curse me for stamping on their bread.&nbsp; The whole <i>soc</i>
was full of people, and there was abundance of bustle, screaming,
and vociferation, and as the sun, though the hour was still
early, was shining with the greatest brilliancy, I thought that I
had scarcely ever witnessed a livelier scene.</p>
<p>Crossing the <i>soc</i>, we entered a narrow street with the
same kind of box-shops on each side, some of which, however, were
either unoccupied or not yet <a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>opened, the lid being closed.&nbsp;
We almost immediately turned to the left, up a street somewhat
similar, and my guide presently entered the door of a low house
which stood at the corner of a little alley, and which he
informed me was the abode of Joanna Correa.&nbsp; We soon stood
in the midst of this habitation.&nbsp; I say the midst, as all
the Moorish houses are built with a small court in the
middle.&nbsp; This one was not more than ten feet square.&nbsp;
It was open at the top, and around it on three sides were
apartments: on the fourth a small staircase, which communicated
with the upper story, half of which consisted of a terrace
looking down into the court, over the low walls of which you
enjoyed a prospect of the sea and a considerable part of the
town.&nbsp; The rest of the story was taken up by a long room,
destined for myself, and which opened upon the terrace by a pair
of folding-doors.&nbsp; At either end of this apartment stood a
bed, extending transversely from wall to wall, the canopy
touching the ceiling.&nbsp; A table and two or three chairs
completed the furniture.</p>
<p>I was so occupied in inspecting the house of Joanna Correa,
that at first I paid little attention to that lady herself.&nbsp;
She now, however, came up upon the terrace where my guide and
myself were standing.&nbsp; She was a woman about five and forty,
with regular features, which had once been handsome, but had
received considerable injury from time, and perhaps more from
trouble.&nbsp; Two of her front teeth had disappeared, but she
still had fine black hair.&nbsp; As I looked upon her
countenance, I said within myself, if there be truth in
physiognomy, thou art good and gentle, O Joanna; and, indeed, the
kindness I experienced from her during the six weeks which I
spent beneath her <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>roof would have made me a convert to that science had I
doubted in it before.&nbsp; I believe no warmer and more
affectionate heart ever beat in human bosom than in that of
Joanna Correa, the Mahonese widow, and it was indexed by features
beaming with benevolence and good nature, though somewhat clouded
with melancholy.</p>
<p>She informed me that she had been married to a Genoese, the
master of a felouk which passed between Gibraltar and Tangier,
who had been dead about four years, leaving her with a family of
four children, the eldest of which was a lad of thirteen; that
she had experienced great difficulty in providing for her family
and herself since the death of her husband, but that Providence
had raised her up a few excellent friends, especially the British
consul; that besides letting lodgings to such travellers as
myself, she made bread which was in high esteem with the Moors,
and that she was likewise in partnership in the sale of liquors
with an old Genoese.&nbsp; She added that this last person lived
below in one of the apartments; that he was a man of great
ability and much learning, but that she believed he was
occasionally somewhat touched here, pointing with her finger to
her forehead, and she therefore hoped that I would not be
offended at anything extraordinary in his language or
behaviour.&nbsp; She then left me, as she said, to give orders
for my breakfast; whereupon the Jewish domestic, who had
accompanied me from the consul, finding that I was established in
the house, departed.</p>
<p>I speedily sat down to breakfast in an apartment on the left
side of the little <i>wustuddur</i>; the fare was excellent: tea,
fried fish, eggs, and grapes, not forgetting the celebrated bread
of Joanna Correa.&nbsp; I <a name="page357"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 357</span>was waited upon by a tall Jewish
youth of about twenty years, who informed me that his name was
Hayim Ben Attar, <a name="citation357a"></a><a
href="#footnote357a" class="citation">[357a]</a> that he was a
native of Fez, from whence his parents brought him at a very
early age to Tangier, where he had passed the greater part of his
life principally in the service of Joanna Correa, waiting upon
those who, like myself, lodged in the house.&nbsp; I had
completed my meal, and was seated in the little court, when I
heard in the apartment opposite to that in which I had
breakfasted several sighs, which were succeeded by as many
groans, and then came <i>Ave Maria</i>, <i>grati&acirc;
plena</i>, <i>ora pro me</i>, <a name="citation357b"></a><a
href="#footnote357b" class="citation">[357b]</a> and finally a
croaking voice chanted&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gentem auferte perfidam<br />
Credentium de finibus,<br />
Ut Christo laudes debitas<br />
Persolvamus alacriter.&rdquo; <a name="citation357c"></a><a
href="#footnote357c" class="citation">[357c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That is the old Genoese,&rdquo; whispered Hayim Ben
Attar, &ldquo;praying to his God, which he always does with
particular devotion when he happens to have gone to bed the
preceding evening rather in liquor.&nbsp; He has in his room a
picture of <i>Maria Buckra</i>, before which he generally burns a
taper, and on her account he will never permit me to enter his
apartment.&nbsp; He once caught me looking at her, and I thought
he would have killed me; and since then he always keeps his
chamber locked, and carries the key in his <a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>pocket when
he goes out.&nbsp; He hates both Jew and Moor, and says that he
is now living amongst them for his sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not place tapers before pictures,&rdquo; said
I, and strolled forth to see the wonders of the land.</p>
<h2><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm">The Mahasni&mdash;Sin Samani&mdash;The

<p>I was standing in the market-place, a spectator of much the
same scene as I have already described, when a Moor came up to me
and attempted to utter a few words in Spanish.&nbsp; He was a
tall elderly man, with sharp but rather whimsical features, and
might have been called good looking, had he not been one-eyed, a
very common deformity in this country. <a
name="citation359"></a><a href="#footnote359"
class="citation">[359]</a>&nbsp; His body was swathed in an
immense <i>haik</i>.&nbsp; Finding that I could understand
Moorish, he instantly began talking with immense volubility, and
I soon learnt that he was a <i>mahasni</i>.&nbsp; He expatiated
diffusely on the beauties of Tangier, of which he said he was a
native, and at last exclaimed, &ldquo;Come, my sultan, come, my
lord, and I will show you many things which will gladden your
eyes, and fill your heart with sunshine; it were a shame in me,
who have the advantage of being a son of Tangier, to permit a
stranger, who comes from an island in the great sea, as you tell
me you do, for the purpose of seeing <a name="page360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>this blessed land, to stand here in
the <i>soc</i> with no one to guide him.&nbsp; By Allah, it shall
not be so.&nbsp; Make room for my sultan, make room for my
lord,&rdquo; he continued, pushing his way through a crowd of men
and children who had gathered round us; &ldquo;it is his
highness&rsquo; pleasure to go with me.&nbsp; This way, my lord,
this way;&rdquo; and he led the way up the hill, walking at a
tremendous rate, and talking still faster.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
street,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the Siarrin, and its like is
not to be found in Tangier; observe how broad it is, even half
the breadth of the <i>soc</i> itself; here are the shops of the
most considerable merchants, where are sold precious articles of
all kinds.&nbsp; Observe those two men, they are Algerines and
good Moslems; they fled from Zair <a name="citation360"></a><a
href="#footnote360" class="citation">[360]</a> when the Nazarenes
conquered it, not by force of fighting, not by valour, as you may
well suppose, but by gold; the Nazarenes only conquer by
gold.&nbsp; The Moor is good, the Moor is strong, who so good and
strong? but he fights not with gold, and therefore he lost
Zair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe you those men seated on the benches by those
portals; they are <i>mokhasniah</i>, they are my brethren.&nbsp;
See their <i>haiks</i> how white, see their turbans how
white.&nbsp; Oh that you could see their swords in the day of
war, for bright, bright are their swords!&nbsp; Now they bear no
swords.&nbsp; Wherefore should they? is there not peace in the
land?&nbsp; See you him in the shop opposite?&nbsp; That is the
Pasha of Tangier, that is the Hamed Sin Samani, the under Pasha
of Tangier; the elder Pasha, my lord, is away on a journey; may
Allah send him a safe return.&nbsp; Yes, that is Hamed; he sits
in his <i>hanutz</i> as were he nought more than a merchant, yet
life and death <a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>are in his hands.&nbsp; There he dispenses justice,
even as he dispenses the essence of the rose and cochineal, and
powder of cannon and sulphur; and these two last he sells on the
account of Abderrahman, my lord and sultan, for none can sell
powder and the sulphur dust in his land but the sultan.&nbsp;
Should you wish to purchase <i>attar del nuar</i>, <a
name="citation361"></a><a href="#footnote361"
class="citation">[361]</a> should you wish to purchase the
essence of the rose, you must go to the <i>hanutz</i> of Sin
Samani, for there only you will get it pure: you must receive it
from no common Moor, but only from Hamed.&nbsp; May Allah bless
Hamed.&nbsp; The <i>makhasniah</i>, my brethren, wait to do his
orders, for wherever sits the Pasha, there is a hall of
judgment.&nbsp; See, now we are opposite the bazaar; beneath yon
gate is the court of the bazaar; what will you not find in that
bazaar?&nbsp; Silks from Fez you will find there: and if you wish
for <i>sibat</i>, if you wish for slippers for your feet, you
must seek them there, and there also are sold curious things from
the towns of the Nazarenes.&nbsp; Those large houses on our left
are habitations of Nazarene consuls; you have seen many such in
your own land, therefore why should you stay to look at
them?&nbsp; Do you not admire this street of the Siarrin?&nbsp;
Whatever enters or goes out of Tangier by the land passes through
this street.&nbsp; Oh, the riches that pass through this
street!&nbsp; Behold those camels, what a long train; twenty,
thirty, a whole <i>cafila</i> descending the street.&nbsp;
<i>Wullah</i>!&nbsp; I know those camels, I know the
driver.&nbsp; Good day, O Sidi Hassim, in how many days from
Fez?&nbsp; And now we are arrived at the wall, and we must pass
under <a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>this gate.&nbsp; This gate is called Bab del Faz; we
are now in the Soc de Barra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Soc de Barra is an open place beyond the upper wall of
Tangier, on the side of the hill.&nbsp; The ground is irregular
and steep; there are, however, some tolerably level spots.&nbsp;
In this place, every Thursday <a name="citation362"></a><a
href="#footnote362" class="citation">[362]</a> and Sunday
morning, a species of mart is held, on which account it is called
Soc de Barra, or the outward market-place.&nbsp; Here and there,
near the town ditch, are subterranean pits, with small orifices,
about the circumference of a chimney, which are generally covered
with a large stone, or stuffed with straw.&nbsp; These pits are
granaries, in which wheat, barley, and other species of grain
intended for sale are stored.&nbsp; On one side are two or three
rude huts, or rather sheds, beneath which keep watch the
guardians of the corn.&nbsp; It is very dangerous to pass over
this hill at night, after the town gates are closed, as at that
time numerous large and ferocious dogs are let loose, who would
to a certainty pull down, and perhaps destroy, any stranger who
should draw nigh.&nbsp; Halfway up the hill are seen four white
walls, inclosing a spot about ten feet square, where rest the
bones of Sidi Mokhfidh, a saint of celebrity, who died some
fifteen years ago.&nbsp; Here terminates the <i>soc</i>; the
remainder of the hill is called El Kawar, or the place of graves,
being the common burying-ground of Tangier; the resting-places of
the dead are severally distinguished by a few stones arranged so
as to form an oblong circle.&nbsp; Near Mokhfidh sleeps Sidi
Gali; but the principal saint of Tangier lies interred on the top
of the hill, in the centre of a small plain.&nbsp; A beautiful
chapel or mosque, with <a name="page363"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 363</span>vaulted roof, is erected there in
his honour, which is in general adorned with banners of various
dyes.&nbsp; The name of this saint is Mohammed <i>el Haji</i>,
and his memory is held in the utmost veneration in Tangier and
its vicinity.&nbsp; His death occurred at the commencement of the
present century.</p>
<p>These details I either gathered at the time or on subsequent
occasions.&nbsp; On the north side of the <i>soc</i>, close by
the town, is a wall with a gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said
the old <i>mahasni</i>, giving a flourish with his hand;
&ldquo;come, and I will show you the garden of a Nazarene
consul.&rdquo;&nbsp; I followed him through the gate, and found
myself in a spacious garden laid out in the European taste, and
planted with lemon and pear trees, and various kinds of aromatic
shrubs.&nbsp; It was, however, evident that the owner chiefly
prided himself on his flowers, of which there were numerous
beds.&nbsp; There was a handsome summer-house, and art seemed to
have exhausted itself in making the place complete.</p>
<p>One thing was wanting, and its absence was strangely
remarkable in a garden at this time of the year; scarcely a leaf
was to be seen.&nbsp; The direst of all the plagues which
devastated Egypt was now busy in this part of Africa&mdash;the
locust was at work, and in no place more fiercely than in the
particular spot where I was now standing.&nbsp; All around looked
blasted.&nbsp; The trees were brown and bald as in winter.&nbsp;
Nothing green save the fruits, especially the grapes, huge
clusters of which were depending from the <i>parras</i>; for the
locust touches not the fruit whilst a single leaf remains to be
devoured.&nbsp; As we passed along the walks, these horrible
insects flew against us in every direction, and perished by
hundreds beneath our feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;See the
<i>ayanas</i>,&rdquo; said the old <i>mahasni</i>, <a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>&ldquo;and
hear them eating.&nbsp; Powerful is the <i>ayana</i>, more
powerful than the sultan or the consul.&nbsp; Should the sultan
send all his <i>makhasniah</i> against the <i>ayana</i>, should
he send me with them, the <i>ayana</i> would say, &lsquo;Ha!
ha!&rsquo;&nbsp; Powerful is the <i>ayana</i>!&nbsp; He fears not
the consul.&nbsp; A few weeks ago the consul said, &lsquo;I am
stronger than the <i>ayana</i>, and I will extirpate him from the
land.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he shouted through the city, &lsquo;O
Tangerines! speed forth to fight the <i>ayana</i>,&mdash;destroy
him in the egg; for know that whosoever shall bring me one pound
weight of the eggs of the <i>ayana</i>, unto him will I give five
<i>reals</i> of Spain; there shall be no <i>ayanas</i> this
year.&rsquo;&nbsp; So all Tangier rushed forth to fight the
<i>ayana</i>, and to collect the eggs which the <i>ayana</i> had
laid to hatch beneath the sand on the sides of the hills, and in
the roads, and in the plains.&nbsp; And my own child, who is
seven years old, went forth to fight the <i>ayana</i>, and he
alone collected eggs to the weight of five pounds, eggs which the
<i>ayana</i> had placed beneath the sand, and he carried them to
the consul, and the consul paid the price.&nbsp; And hundreds
carried eggs to the consul, more or less, and the consul paid
them the price, and in less than three days the treasure chest of
the consul was exhausted.&nbsp; And then he cried, &lsquo;Desist,
O Tangerines! perhaps we have destroyed the <i>ayana</i>, perhaps
we have destroyed them all!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; Look
around you, and beneath you, and above you, and tell me whether
the consul has destroyed the <i>ayana</i>.&nbsp; Oh, powerful is
the <i>ayana</i>!&nbsp; More powerful than the consul, more
powerful than the sultan and all his armies.&rdquo; <a
name="citation364"></a><a href="#footnote364"
class="citation">[364]</a></p>
<p><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>It
will be as well to observe here, that within a week from this
time all the locusts had disappeared, no one knew how&mdash;only
a few stragglers remained.&nbsp; But for this providential
deliverance, the fields and gardens in the vicinity of Tangier
would have been totally devastated.&nbsp; These insects were of
an immense size, and of a loathly appearance.</p>
<p>We now passed over the <i>soc</i> to the opposite side, where
stand the huts of the guardians.&nbsp; Here a species of lane
presents itself, which descends to the seashore; it is deep and
precipitous, and resembles a gully or ravine.&nbsp; The banks on
either side are covered with the tree which bears the prickly
fig, called in Moorish, <i>Kermous del Inde</i>. <a
name="citation365"></a><a href="#footnote365"
class="citation">[365]</a>&nbsp; There is something wild and
grotesque in the appearance of this tree or plant, for I know not
which to call it.&nbsp; Its stem, though frequently of the
thickness of a man&rsquo;s body, has no head, but divides itself,
at a short distance from the ground, into many crooked branches,
which shoot in all directions, and bear green and uncouth leaves,
about half an inch in thickness, and which, if they resemble
anything, present the appearance of the fore fins of a seal, and
consist of multitudinous fibres.&nbsp; The fruit, which somewhat
resembles a pear, has a rough tegument covered with minute
prickles, which instantly enter the hand which touches them,
however slightly, and are very difficult to extract.&nbsp; I
never remember to have seen vegetation in ranker luxuriance than
that which these fig-trees exhibited, nor upon the whole a more
singular spot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said <a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>the
<i>mahasni</i>, &ldquo;and I will show you something which you
will like to see.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he turned to the left, leading
the way by a narrow path up the steep bank, till we reached the
summit of a hillock, separated by a deep ditch from the wall of
Tangier.&nbsp; The ground was thickly covered with the trees
already described, which spread their strange arms along the
surface, and whose thick leaves crushed beneath our feet as we
walked along.&nbsp; Amongst them I observed a large number of
stone slabs lying horizontally; they were rudely scrawled over
with odd characters, which stooped down to inspect.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you <i>talib</i> enough read those signs?&rdquo;
exclaimed the old Moor.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are letters of the
accursed Jews; this is their <i>mearrah</i>, as they call it, and
here they inter their dead.&nbsp; Fools, they trust in Muza, when
they might believe in Mohammed, and therefore their dead shall
burn everlastingly in <i>Jehinnim</i>.&nbsp; See, my sultan, how
fat is the soil of this <i>mearrah</i> of the Jews; see what
<i>kermous</i> grow here.&nbsp; When I was a boy I often came to
the <i>mearrah</i> of the Jews to eat <i>kermous</i> in the
season of their ripeness.&nbsp; The Moslem boys of Tangier love
the <i>kermous</i> of the <i>mearrah</i> of the Jews; but the
Jews will not gather them.&nbsp; They say that the waters of the
springs which nourish the roots of these trees pass among the
bodies of their dead, and for that reason it is an abomination to
taste of these fruits.&nbsp; Be this true, or be it not, one
thing is certain, in whatever manner nourished, good are the
<i>kermous</i> which grow in the <i>mearrah</i> of the
Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We returned to the lane by the same path by which we had come:
as we were descending it he said, &ldquo;Know, my sultan, that
the name of the place where we now are, and which you say you
like much, <a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>is Dar-sinah. <a name="citation367a"></a><a
href="#footnote367a" class="citation">[367a]</a>&nbsp; You will
ask me why it bears that name, as you see neither house nor man,
neither Moslem, Nazarene, nor Jew, only our two selves; I will
tell you, my sultan, for who can tell you better than
myself?&nbsp; Learn, I pray you, that Tangier was not always what
it is now, nor did it occupy always the place which it does
now.&nbsp; It stood yonder (pointing to the east) on those hills
above the shore, and ruins of houses are still to be seen there,
and the spot is called Old Tangier.&nbsp; So in the old time, as
I have heard say, this Dar-sinah was a street, whether without or
within the wall matters not, and there resided men of all trades;
smiths of gold, and silver, and iron, and tin, and artificers of
all kinds.&nbsp; You had only to go to the Dar-sinah if you
wished for any thing wrought, and there instantly you would find
a master of the particular craft.&nbsp; My sultan tells me he
likes the look of Dar-sinah at the present day; truly I know not
why, especially as the <i>kermous</i> are not yet in their
ripeness, nor fit to eat.&nbsp; If he likes Dar-sinah now, how
would my sultan have liked it in the old time, when it was filled
with gold and silver, and iron and tin, and was noisy with the
hammers, and the masters and the cunning men?&nbsp; We are now
arrived at the <i>Chali del Bahar</i>. <a
name="citation367b"></a><a href="#footnote367b"
class="citation">[367b]</a>&nbsp; Take care, my sultan, we tread
upon bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had emerged from the Dar-sinah, and the seashore was before
us; on a sudden we found ourselves amongst a multitude of bones
of all kinds of animals, and seemingly of all dates; some being
blanched with time and exposure to sun and wind, whilst to <a
name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 368</span>others the
flesh still partly clung; whole carcases were here, horses,
asses, and even the uncouth remains of a camel.&nbsp; Gaunt dogs
were busy here, growling, tearing, and gnawing; amongst whom,
unintimidated, stalked the carrion vulture, fiercely battening
and even disputing with the brutes the garbage; whilst the crow
hovered overhead, and croaked wistfully, or occasionally perched
upon some upturned rib bone.&nbsp; &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the
<i>mahasni</i>, &ldquo;the <i>kawar</i> of the animals.&nbsp; My
sultan has seen the <i>kawar</i> of the Moslems and the
<i>mearrah</i> of the Jews; and he sees here the <i>kawar</i> of
the animals.&nbsp; All the animals which die in Tangier by the
hand of God&mdash;horse, dog, or camel&mdash;are brought to this
spot, and here they putrefy or are devoured by the birds of the
heaven or the wild creatures that prowl on the
<i>chali</i>.&nbsp; Come, my sultan, it is not good to remain
long in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were preparing to leave the spot, when we heard a galloping
down the Dar-sinah, and presently a horse and rider darted at
full speed from the mouth of the lane and appeared upon the
strand: the horseman, when he saw us, pulled up his steed with
much difficulty, and joined us.&nbsp; The horse was small but
beautiful, a sorrel with long mane and tail; had he been
hoodwinked he might perhaps have been mistaken for a Cordovese
<i>jaca</i>; he was broad-chested, and rotund in his hind
quarters, and possessed much of the plumpness and sleekness which
distinguish that breed, but looking in his eyes you would have
been undeceived in a moment; a wild savage fire darted from the
restless orbs, and so far from exhibiting the docility of the
other noble and loyal animal, he occasionally plunged
desperately, <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>and could scarcely be restrained by a strong curb and
powerful arm from resuming his former head-long course.&nbsp; The
rider was a youth, apparently about eighteen, dressed as a
European, with a <i>montero</i> cap on his head: he was
athletically built, but with lengthy limbs, his feet, for he rode
without stirrups or saddle, reaching almost to the ground; his
complexion was almost as dark as that of a Mulatto; his features
very handsome, the eyes particularly so, but filled with an
expression which was bold and bad; and there was a disgusting
look of sensuality about the mouth.&nbsp; He addressed a few
words to the <i>mahasni</i>, with whom he seemed to be well
acquainted, inquiring who I was.&nbsp; The old man answered,
&ldquo;O Jew, my sultan understands our speech, thou hadst better
address thyself to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lad then spoke to me in
Arabic, but almost instantly dropping that language, proceeded to
discourse in tolerable French.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you are
French,&rdquo; said he with much familiarity; &ldquo;shall you
stay long in Tangier?&rdquo;&nbsp; Having received an answer, he
proceeded, &ldquo;as you are an Englishman, you are doubtless
fond of horses; know, therefore, whenever you are disposed for a
ride, I will accompany you, and procure you horses.&nbsp; My name
is Ephraim Fragey: I am stable-boy to the Neapolitan consul, who
prizes himself upon possessing the best horses in Tangier; you
shall mount any you please.&nbsp; Would you like to try this
little <i>aoud</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; I thanked him, but declined his
offer for the present, asking him at the same time how he had
acquired the French language, and why he, a Jew, did not appear
in the dress of his brethren?&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in the service of
a consul,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and my master obtained
permission <a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>that I might dress myself in this manner; and as to
speaking French, I have been to Marseilles and Naples, to which
last place I conveyed horses, presents from the sultan.&nbsp;
Besides French, I can speak Italian.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
dismounted, and holding the horse firmly by the bridle with one
hand, proceeded to undress himself, which having accomplished, he
mounted the animal and rode into the water.&nbsp; The skin of his
body was much akin in colour to that of a frog or toad, but the
frame was that of a young Titan.&nbsp; The horse took to the
water with great unwillingness, and at a small distance from the
shore commenced struggling with his rider, whom he twice dashed
from his back; the lad, however, clung to the bridle, and
detained the animal.&nbsp; All his efforts, however, being
unavailing to ride him deeper in, he fell to washing him
strenuously with his hands, then leading him out, he dressed
himself and returned by the way he came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good are the horses of the Moslems,&rdquo; said my old
friend; &ldquo;where will you find such?&nbsp; They will descend
rocky mountains at full speed and neither trip nor fall; but you
must be cautious with the horses of the Moslems, and treat them
with kindness, for the horses of the Moslems are proud, and they
like not being slaves.&nbsp; When they are young and first
mounted, jerk not their mouths with your bit, for be sure if you
do they will kill you; sooner or later, you will perish beneath
their feet.&nbsp; Good are our horses, and good our riders, yea,
very good are the Moslems at mounting the horse; who are like
them?&nbsp; I once saw a Frank rider compete with a Moslem on
this beach, and at first the Frank rider had it all his own way,
and he passed the Moslem, but the course was <a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>long, very
long, and the horse of the Frank rider, which was a Frank also,
panted; but the horse of the Moslem panted not, for he was a
Moslem also, and the Moslem rider at last gave a cry and the
horse sprang forward and he overtook the Frank horse, and then
the Moslem rider stood up in his saddle.&nbsp; How did he
stand?&nbsp; Truly he stood on his head, and these eyes saw him;
he stood on his head in the saddle as he passed the Frank rider;
and he cried ha! ha! as he passed the Frank rider; and the Moslem
horse cried ha! ha! as he passed the Frank breed, and the Frank
lost by a far distance.&nbsp; Good are the Franks; good their
horses; but better are the Moslems, and better are the horses of
the Moslems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now directed our steps towards the town, but not by the
path we came: turning to the left under the hill of the
<i>mearrah</i>, and along the strand, we soon came to a
rudely-paved way with a steep ascent, which wound beneath the
wall of the town to a gate, before which, on one side, were
various little pits like graves, filled with water or lime.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is Dar-dwag,&rdquo; said the <i>mahasni</i>;
&ldquo;this is the house of the bark, and to this house are
brought the hides; all those which are prepared for use in
Tangier are brought to this house, and here they are cured with
lime, and bran, and bark, and herbs.&nbsp; And in this Dar-dwag
there are one hundred and forty pits; I have counted them myself;
and there were more which have now ceased to be, for the place is
very ancient.&nbsp; And these pits are hired not by one, nor by
two, but by many people, and whosoever list can rent one of these
pits and cure the hides which he may need; but the owner of all
is one man, and his name is Cado Ableque.&nbsp; And now my sultan
has <a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>seen
the house of the bark, and I will show him nothing more this day;
for to-day is <i>Youm al Jumal</i>, <a name="citation372"></a><a
href="#footnote372" class="citation">[372]</a> and the gates will
be presently shut whilst the Moslems perform their
devotions.&nbsp; So I will accompany my sultan to the guest
house, and there I will leave him for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We accordingly passed through a gate, and ascending a street
found ourselves before the mosque where I had stood in the
morning; in another minute or two we were at the door of Joanna
Correa.&nbsp; I now offered my kind guide a piece of silver as a
remuneration for his trouble, whereupon he drew himself up and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silver of my sultan I will not take, for I consider
that I have done nothing to deserve it.&nbsp; We have not yet
visited all the wonderful things of this blessed town.&nbsp; On a
future day I will conduct my sultan to the castle of the
governor, and to other places which my sultan will be glad to
see; and when we have seen all we can, and my sultan is content
with me, if at any time he see me in the <i>soc</i> of a morning,
with my basket in my hand, and he see nothing in that basket,
then is my sultan at liberty as a friend to put grapes in my
basket, or bread in my basket, or fish or meat in my
basket.&nbsp; That will I not refuse of my sultan, when I shall
have done more for him than I have now.&nbsp; But the silver of
my sultan will I not take now nor at any time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then waved his hand gently, and departed.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Strange Trio&mdash;The Mulatto&mdash;The
Peace-offering&mdash;Moors of Granada&mdash;Vive la
Guadeloupe&mdash;The Moors&mdash;Pascual Fava&mdash;Blind
Algerine&mdash;The Retreat.</p>
<p>Three men were seated in the <i>wustuddur</i> of Joanna
Correa, when I entered; singular-looking men they all were,
though perhaps three were never gathered together more unlike to
each other in all points.&nbsp; The first on whom I cast my eye
was a man about sixty, dressed in a grey kerseymere coat with
short lappets, yellow waistcoat, and wide coarse canvas trousers;
upon his head was a very broad dirty straw hat, and in his hand
he held a thick cane with ivory handle; his eyes were bleared and
squinting, his face rubicund, and his nose much carbuncled.&nbsp;
Beside him sat a good-looking black, who perhaps appeared more
negro than he really was, from the circumstance of his being
dressed in spotless white jean&mdash;jerkin, waistcoat, and
pantaloons being all of that material: his head gear consisted of
a blue <i>montero</i> cap.&nbsp; His eyes sparkled like diamonds,
and there was an indescribable expression of good humour and fun
upon his countenance.&nbsp; The third man was a Mulatto, and by
far the most remarkable personage of the group: he might be
between thirty and forty; his body was very long, and, though
uncouthly put together, <a name="page374"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 374</span>exhibited every mark of strength and
vigour; it was cased in a <i>ferioul</i> of red wool, a kind of
garment which descends below the hips.&nbsp; His long, muscular,
and hairy arms were naked from the elbow, where the sleeves of
the <i>ferioul</i> terminate; his under limbs were short in
comparison with his body and arms; his legs were bare, but he
wore blue <i>kandrisa</i> as far as the knee; every feature of
his face was ugly, exceedingly and bitterly ugly, and one of his
eyes was sightless, being covered with a white film.&nbsp; By his
side on the ground was a large barrel, seemingly a water-cask,
which he occasionally seized with a finger and thumb, and waved
over his head as if it had been a quart pot.&nbsp; Such was the
trio who now occupied the <i>wustuddur</i> of Joanna Correa: and
I had scarcely time to remark what I have just recorded, when
that good lady entered from a back court with her handmaid
Joh&aacute;r, or the pearl, an ugly fat Jewish girl with an
immense mole on her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Que Dios remate tu nombre</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed the
Mulatto; &ldquo;may Allah blot out your name, Joanna, and may he
likewise blot out that of your maid Joh&aacute;r.&nbsp; It is
more than fifteen minutes that I have been seated here, after
having poured out into the <i>tinaja</i> the water which I
brought from the fountain, and during all that time I have waited
in vain for one single word of civility from yourself or from
Joh&aacute;r.&nbsp; <i>Usted no tiene modo</i>, you have no
manner with you, nor more has Joh&aacute;r.&nbsp; This is the
only house in Tangier where I am not received with fitting love
and respect, and yet I have done more for you than for any other
person.&nbsp; Have I not filled your <i>tinaja</i> with water
when other people have gone without a drop?&nbsp; When even the
consul and the <a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
375</span>interpreter of the consul had no water to slake their
thirst, have you not had enough to wash your
<i>wustuddur</i>?&nbsp; And what is my return?&nbsp; When I
arrive in the heat of the day, I have not one kind word spoken to
me, nor so much as a glass of <i>makhiah</i> offered to me; must
I tell you all that I do for you, Joanna?&nbsp; Truly I must, for
you have no manner with you.&nbsp; Do I not come every morning
just at the third hour; and do I not knock at your door; and do
you not arise and let me in, and then do I not knead your bread
in your presence, whilst you lie in bed, and because I knead it
is not yours the best bread in Tangier?&nbsp; For am I not the
strongest man in Tangier, and the most noble also?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he brandished his barrel over his head, and his face looked
almost demoniacal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear me, Joanna,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;you know that I am the strongest man in
Tangier, and I tell you again for the thousandth time, that I am
the most noble.&nbsp; Who are the consuls?&nbsp; Who is the
Pasha?&nbsp; They are Pashas and consuls now, but who were their
fathers?&nbsp; I know not, nor do they.&nbsp; But do I not know
who <i>my</i> fathers; were?&nbsp; Were they not Moors of Garnata
(<i>Granada</i>), <a name="citation375"></a><a
href="#footnote375" class="citation">[375]</a> and is it not on
that account that I am <a name="page376"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 376</span>the strongest man in Tangier?&nbsp;
Yes, I am of the old Moors of Garnata, and my family has lived
here, as is well known, since Garnata was lost to the Nazarenes,
and now I am the only one of my family of the blood of the old
Moors in all this land, and on that account I am of nobler blood
than the sultan, for the sultan is not of the blood of the Moors
of Garnata.&nbsp; Do you laugh, Joanna?&nbsp; Does your maid
Joh&aacute;r laugh?&nbsp; Am I not Hammin Widdir, <i>el hombre
mas valido de Tanger</i>? <a name="citation376a"></a><a
href="#footnote376a" class="citation">[376a]</a>&nbsp; And is it
not true that I am of the blood of the Moors of Garnata?&nbsp;
Deny it, and I will kill you both, you and your maid
Joh&aacute;r.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been eating <i>hsheesh</i> and <i>majoon</i>,
Hammin,&rdquo; said Joanna Correa, &ldquo;and the
<i>Shait&aacute;n</i> has entered into you, as he but too
frequently does.&nbsp; I have been busy, and so has Joh&aacute;r,
or we should have spoken to you before; however, <i>ma
ydoorshee</i>, <a name="citation376b"></a><a href="#footnote376b"
class="citation">[376b]</a> I know how to pacify you now and at
all times; will you take some gin-bitters, or a glass of common
<i>makhiah</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May you burst, O Joanna,&rdquo; said the Mulatto,
&ldquo;and may Joh&aacute;r also burst; I mean, may you both live
many years, and know neither pain nor sorrow.&nbsp; I will take
the gin-bitters, O Joanna, because they are stronger than the
<i>makhiah</i>, which always appears to me like water; and I like
not water, though I <a name="page377"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 377</span>carry it.&nbsp; Many thanks to you,
Joanna; here is health to you, Joanna, and to this good
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had handed him a large tumbler filled to the brim; he put
it to his nostrils, snuffed in the flavour, and then, applying it
to his mouth, removed it not whilst one drop of the fluid
remained.&nbsp; His features gradually relaxed from their former
angry expression, and looking particularly amiable at Joanna, he
at last said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that within a little time, O Joanna, you will be
persuaded that I am the strongest man in Tangier, and that I am
sprung from the blood of the Moors of Garnata, as then you will
no longer refuse to take me for a husband, you and your maid
Joh&aacute;r, and to become Moors.&nbsp; What a glory to you,
after having been married to a <i>Genoui</i>, and given birth to
<i>Genouillos</i>, to receive for husband a Moor like me, and to
bear him children of the blood of Garnata!&nbsp; What a glory,
too, for Joh&aacute;r!&mdash;how much better than to marry a vile
Jew, even like Hayim Ben Attar, or your cook Sabia, both of whom
I could strangle with two fingers, for am I not Hammin Widdir,
<i>Moro de Garnata</i>, <i>el hombre mas valido de
Tanger</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; He then shouldered his barrel and
departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Mulatto really what he pretends to be?&rdquo;
said I to Joanna; &ldquo;is he a descendant of the Moors of
Granada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always talks about the Moors of Granada, when he is
mad with <i>majoon</i> or <i>aguardiente</i>,&rdquo; interrupted,
in bad French, the old man whom I have before described, and in
the same croaking voice which I had heard chanting in the
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nevertheless it may be true, and if he had
not heard something of the kind from his parents, he would <a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>never have
imagined such a thing, for he is too stupid.&nbsp; As I said
before, it is by no means impossible: many of the families of
Granada settled down here when their town was taken by the
Christians, but the greater part went to Tunis.&nbsp; When I was
there, I lodged in the house of a Moor who called himself Zegri,
<a name="citation378"></a><a href="#footnote378"
class="citation">[378]</a> and was always talking of Granada and
the things which his forefathers had done there.&nbsp; He would
moreover sit for hours singing romances of which I understood not
one word, praised be the Mother of God, but which he said all
related to his family: there were hundreds of that name in Tunis,
therefore why should not this Hammin, this drunken water-carrier,
be a Moor of Granada also?&nbsp; He is ugly enough to be emperor
of all the Moors.&nbsp; Oh, the accursed <i>canaille</i>!&nbsp; I
have lived amongst them for my sins these eight years, at Oran
and here.&nbsp; <i>Monsieur</i>, do you not consider it to be a
hard case for an old man like myself, who am a Christian, to live
amongst a race who know not God, nor Christ, nor anything
holy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by asserting
that the Moors know not God?&nbsp; There is no people in the
world who entertain sublimer notions of the uncreated eternal God
than the Moors, and no people have ever shown themselves more
zealous for His honour and glory: their very zeal for the glory
of God has been and is the chief obstacle to their becoming
Christians.&nbsp; They are afraid of compromising His dignity by
supposing that He ever condescended to become man.&nbsp; And with
respect to Christ, their ideas even of Him are much more just
than those of the Papists; they say He is a mighty prophet,
whilst, according to the others, He is either <a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>a piece of
bread, or a helpless infant.&nbsp; In many points of religion the
Moors are wrong, dreadfully wrong; but are the Papists less
so?&nbsp; And one of their practices sets them immeasurably below
the Moors in the eyes of any unprejudiced person: they bow down
to idols, Christian idols if you like, but idols still, things
graven of wood, and stone, and brass; and from these things,
which can neither hear, nor speak, nor feel, they ask and expect
to obtain favours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vive la France</i>, <i>Vive la
Guadeloupe</i>!&rdquo; said the black, with a good French
accent.&nbsp; &ldquo;In France and in Guadeloupe there is no
superstition, and they pay as much regard to the Bible as to the
Koran; I am now learning to read, in order that I may understand
the writings of Voltaire, who, as I am told, has proved that both
the one and the other were written with the sole intention of
deceiving mankind.&nbsp; <i>O</i>, <i>vive la France</i>! where
will you find such an enlightened country as France; and where
will you find such a plentiful country as France?&nbsp; Only one
in the world, and that is Guadeloupe.&nbsp; Is it not so,
Monsieur Pascual?&nbsp; Were you ever at Marseilles?&nbsp; <i>Ah
quel bon pays est celui-l&agrave; pour les vivres</i>, <i>pour
les petits poulets</i>, <i>pour les poulardes</i>, <i>pour les
perdrix</i>, <i>pour les perdreaux</i>, <i>pour les
alouettes</i>, <i>pour les b&eacute;casses</i>, <i>pour les
b&eacute;cassines</i>, <i>enfin</i>, <i>pour tout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir, are you a cook?&rdquo; demanded I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Monsieur</i>, <i>je le suis pour vous rendre
service</i>, <i>mon nom c&rsquo;est G&eacute;rard</i>, <i>et
j&rsquo;ai l&rsquo;honneur d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre chef de cuisine
chez monsieur le consul Hollandois</i>.&nbsp; <i>A present je
prie permission de vous saluer</i>; <i>il faut que j&rsquo;aille
&agrave; la maison pour faire le diner de mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At four I went to dine with the British consul.&nbsp; Two
other English gentlemen were present, who <a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>had arrived
at Tangier from Gibraltar about ten days previously for a short
excursion, and were now detained longer than they wished by the
Levant wind.&nbsp; They had already visited the principal towns
in Spain, and proposed spending the winter either at Cadiz or
Seville.&nbsp; One of them, Mr. ---, struck me as being one of
the most remarkable men I had ever conversed with: he travelled
not for diversion nor instigated by curiosity, but merely with
the hope of doing spiritual good, chiefly by conversation.&nbsp;
The consul soon asked me what I thought of the Moors and their
country.&nbsp; I told him that what I had hitherto seen of both
highly pleased me.&nbsp; He said that were I to live amongst them
ten years, as he had done, he believed I should entertain a very
different opinion; that no people in the world were more false
and cruel; that their government was one of the vilest
description, with which it was next to an impossibility for any
foreign power to hold amicable relations, as it invariably acted
with bad faith, and set at nought the most solemn treaties.&nbsp;
That British property and interests were every day subjected to
ruin and spoliation, and British subjects exposed to unheard-of
vexations, without the slightest hope of redress being offered,
save recourse was had to force, the only argument to which the
Moors were accessible.&nbsp; He added, that towards the end of
the preceding year an atrocious murder had been perpetrated in
Tangier: a Genoese family of three individuals had perished, all
of whom were British subjects, and entitled to the protection of
the British flag.&nbsp; The murderers were known, and the
principal one was even now in prison for the fact; yet all
attempts to bring him to condign punishment had hitherto proved
abortive, as he was a Moor, and his victims Christians.&nbsp; <a
name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>Finally, he
cautioned me not to take walks beyond the wall unaccompanied by a
soldier, whom he offered to provide for me should I desire it, as
otherwise I incurred great risk of being ill-treated by the Moors
of the interior, whom I might meet, or perhaps murdered; and he
instanced the case of a British officer who not long since had
been murdered on the beach for no other reason than being a
Nazarene, and appearing in a Nazarene dress.&nbsp; He at length
introduced the subject of the Gospel, and I was pleased to learn
that, during his residence in Tangier, he had distributed a
considerable quantity of Bibles amongst the natives in the Arabic
language, and that many of the learned men, or <i>talibs</i>, had
read the holy volume with great interest, and that by this
distribution, which, it is true, was effected with much caution,
no angry or unpleasant feeling had been excited.&nbsp; He finally
asked whether I had come with the intention of circulating the
Scripture amongst the Moors.</p>
<p>I replied that I had no opportunity of doing so, as I had not
one single copy either in the Arabic language or character.&nbsp;
That the few Testaments which were in my possession were in the
Spanish language, and were intended for circulation amongst the
Christians of Tangier, to whom they might be serviceable, as they
all understood the language.</p>
<p>It was night, and I was seated in the <i>wustuddur</i> of
Joanna Correa, in company with Pascual Fava, the Genoese.&nbsp;
The old man&rsquo;s favourite subject of discourse appeared to be
religion, and he professed unbounded love for the Saviour, and
the deepest sense of gratitude for his miraculous atonement for
the sins of mankind.&nbsp; I should have listened to him with
pleasure had he not smelt very strongly of liquor, <a
name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 382</span>and by
certain incoherences of language and wildness of manner given
indications of being in some degree the worse for it.&nbsp;
Suddenly two figures appeared beneath the doorway; one was that
of a bareheaded and bare-legged Moorish boy of about ten years of
age, dressed in a <i>gelaba</i>.&nbsp; He guided by the hand an
old man, whom I at once recognized as one of the Algerines, the
good Moslems of whom the old <i>mahasni</i> had spoken in terms
of praise in the morning whilst we ascended the street of the
Siarrin.&nbsp; He was very short of stature and dirty in his
dress; the lower part of his face was covered with a stubbly
white beard; before his eyes he wore a large pair of spectacles,
from which he evidently received but little benefit, as he
required the assistance of the guide at every step.&nbsp; The two
advanced a little way into the <i>wustuddur</i>, and there
stopped.&nbsp; Pascual Fava no sooner beheld them, than assuming
a jovial air he started nimbly up, and leaning on his stick, for
he had a bent leg, limped to a cupboard, out of which he took a
bottle and poured out a glass of wine, singing in the broken kind
of Spanish used by the Moors of the coast&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Argelino,<br />
Moro fino,<br />
No beber vino,<br />
Ni comer tocino.&rdquo; <a name="citation382"></a><a
href="#footnote382" class="citation">[382]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then handed the wine to the old Moor, who drank it off, and
then, led by the boy, made for the door without saying a
word.</p>
<p><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>&ldquo;<i>Hade mushe halal</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation383a"></a><a href="#footnote383a"
class="citation">[383a]</a> said I to him with a loud voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cul shee halal</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation383b"></a><a href="#footnote383b"
class="citation">[383b]</a> said the old Moor, turning his
sightless and spectacled eyes in the direction from which my
voice reached him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of everything which God has
given, it is lawful for the children of God to
partake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that old man?&rdquo; said I to Pascual Fava,
after the blind and the leader of the blind had departed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who is he!&rdquo; said Pascual; &ldquo;who is he!&nbsp; He
is a merchant now, and keeps a shop in the Siarrin, but there was
a time when no bloodier pirate sailed out of Algier.&nbsp; That
old blind wretch has cut more throats than he has hairs in his
beard.&nbsp; Before the French took the place he was the
<i>rais</i> or captain of a frigate, and many was the poor
Sardinian vessel which fell into his hands.&nbsp; After that
affair he fled to Tangier, and it is said that he brought with
him a great part of the booty which he had amassed in former
times.&nbsp; Many other Algerines came hither also, or to Tetuan,
but he is the strangest guest of them all.&nbsp; He keeps
occasionally very extraordinary company for a Moor, and is rather
over-intimate with the Jews.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s no business
of mine; only let him look to himself.&nbsp; If the Moors should
once suspect him, it were all over with him.&nbsp; Moors and
Jews, Jews and Moors!&nbsp; Oh my poor sins, my poor sins, that
brought me to live amongst them!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;Ave maris stella,<br />
Dei Mater alma,<br />
Atque semper virgo,<br />
Felix c&oelig;li porta!&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation383c"></a><a href="#footnote383c"
class="citation">[383c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>He
was proceeding in this manner when I was startled by the sound of
a musket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the retreat,&rdquo; said Pascual Fava.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is fired every night in the <i>soc</i> at half-past
eight, and it is the signal for suspending all business, and
shutting up.&nbsp; I am now going to close the doors, and
whosoever knocks, I shall not admit them till I know their
voice.&nbsp; Since the murder of the poor Genoese last year, we
have all been particularly cautious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus had passed Friday, the sacred day of the Moslems, and the
first which I had spent in Tangier.&nbsp; I observed that the
Moors followed their occupations as if the day had nothing
particular in it.&nbsp; Between twelve and one, the hour of
prayer in the mosque, the gates of the town were closed, and no
one permitted either to enter or go out.&nbsp; There is a
tradition current amongst them, that on this day, and at this
hour, their eternal enemies, the Nazarenes, will arrive to take
possession of their country; on which account they hold
themselves prepared against a surprisal.</p>

&ldquo;The great oath of Spain, which ought never to be written

language of the lower orders; it is a most ancient remnant of the
phallic abjuration of the evil eye, the dreaded fascination which
still perplexes the minds of Orientals, and is not banished from
Spanish and Neapolitan superstitions.&nbsp; The word terminates
in <i>ajo</i>, on which stress is laid; the <i>j</i> is
pronounced with a most Arabic guttural aspiration.&nbsp; The word
<i>ajo</i> means also garlic, which is quite as often in Spanish
mouths, and is exactly what Hotspur liked&mdash;a

Bohemian gypsy <i>x&aacute;ro</i>, Hungarian <i>h&aacute;ro</i> =
sabre, and the Span.<i> canalla</i>, but I have no reason to
suppose that the word <i>x&aacute;ro</i> or <i>h&aacute;ro</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Jargon</span>.&nbsp; <i>Eng.</i>&nbsp;
Originally a Fr. word, meaning any unintelligible sound, as that
of birds, then applied to the strange speech of the <i>Gueux</i>;
and so to any unknown tongue.&nbsp; Borrow himself says of the
gypsies, &ldquo;when wishing to praise the proficiency of any
individual in their tongue, they are in the habit of saying,
&lsquo;He understands the seven jargons&rsquo;&rdquo; (Z. ii.
125).&nbsp; Frampton Boswell is recorded (G. i. 374) to have
stated that Romany was not one of &ldquo;the seven
languages,&rdquo; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; adds Mr. <a
name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 405</span>Hinde
Groome, &ldquo;what he meant thereby, goodness alone
knows.&rdquo;&nbsp; The historian Mazaris (<span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1416) states that at that time the
Peloponnesus was inhabited by seven principal nations, one of
which was that of the Egyptians.&nbsp; These
&ldquo;Egyptians&rdquo; are held by M. Bataillard to have been
gypsies (<i>ib.</i> iii. 154), and I would suggest that we have
here the origin of &ldquo;the seven jargons.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
number seven seems to be in a special way connected with the
children of Roma.&nbsp; For other instances see Leland,

another explanation.&nbsp; J. gives <i>ardiente</i> =

or <i>jar</i> (<i>ib.</i> 171) = heat.&nbsp; Change the <a

of the oldest and most interesting foundations in Spain.&nbsp;
The first stone was laid by Alfonso II. in 802; the greater part
of the existing edifice is of the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>But the great glory of Oviedo, entitling it to rank as second
among the holy cities of Christian Spain, is the Camara Santa,
and the relics therein contained (see Burke&rsquo;s <i>History of
Spain</i> vol. i. pp. 122&ndash;124, 140, 141, 147&ndash;150,

and having assumed the Benedictine habit early in life, settled
at length in a convent of his order at Oviedo, where he lived for
hard on fifty years.&nbsp; He died in 1764.</p>
<p>A strange mixture of a devout Catholic and a scientific
innovator, he was an earnest student of Bacon, Newton, Pascal,
Leibnitz, and others, whose opinions he embodied in his own
works.&nbsp; Learned, judicious, and diligent rather than a man
of genius, he was original at least as regards his conceptions of
the nature and limits of scientific research in Spain.&nbsp; He
kept on good terms with the Inquisition, while he continued to
publish in his <i>Teatro Critico</i> and his <i>Cartas Eruditas y
Curiosas</i> all that the Inquisitors would desire to remain
unread; attacked the dialectics and metaphysics then taught
everywhere in Spain; maintained Bacon&rsquo;s system of induction
in the physical sciences; ridiculed the general opinion as
regards eclipses, comets, magic, and divination; and laid down
canons of historical criticism which would exclude many of the
most cherished traditions of his country and his Church.&nbsp;
The best edition of his works is that by Campomanes, the minister
of the enlightened Charles III., with a Life of the author.&nbsp;
16 vols.&nbsp; Madrid, 1778.</p>

in an English West India regiment, served in the Spanish American
forces, and afterwards obtained a commission in the Spanish
army.&nbsp; In 1833, on the outbreak of the civil war, he
declared for Isabella, and served with considerable distinction
in the constitutional army.&nbsp; A prisoner in 1836, he was
entrusted with a high command at Toledo in 1837, but having
failed to satisfy the Cortes in an engagement in September, 1838,
he cut his throat (see <i>Gentl. Mag.</i>, 1838, vol. ii. p. 553,
and Duncan, <i>The English in Spain</i>, pp. 13, 189).</p>

frequented high-road from Santander to Burgos, inasmuch as the
railway from Santander to Madrid takes a more westerly route
through Palencia, the actual junction with the main line from
Irun being at Venta de Ba&ntilde;os, a new creation of the
railway not even mentioned in the guidebooks a few years ago, and
now one of the most important stations in Spain.</p>
<p>Yet in railway matters Spain has still some progress to
make.&nbsp; From Santander to Burgos <i>vi&acirc;</i> Venta de
Ba&ntilde;os is just 120 English miles; but the time occupied in
the journey by train in this year 1895 is just seventeen hours,
the traveller having to leave Santander at 1 p.m. in order to
reach Burgos at 6 o&rsquo;clock the following morning!</p>

praised in the text is said by Professor Justi to be in

performance.&nbsp; There are many of <i>El Greco&rsquo;s</i>
pictures in Italy, where his work is often assigned to Bassano,
Paul Veronese, and Titian.&nbsp; His acknowledged masterpiece is
the Christ on Mount Calvary in the cathedral of Toledo.&nbsp;

from.&nbsp; <i>Don Juan</i> had not been published more than
fifteen years at the time, and was in the zenith of its
popularity.&nbsp; But Byron and his ways were alike odious to the
rough manliness of Borrow (see <i>Lavengro</i>, ch. xxxix.), and,
in good truth, however much the poet &ldquo;deserves to be
remembered,&rdquo; it is certainly not for this line, which
contains as many <i>suggestiones falsi</i> as may be packed into
one line.&nbsp; Yet the &ldquo;sneer&rdquo; is not in the
original, but in Borrow&rsquo;s misquotation; Byron wrote
&ldquo;smiled.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of the poet having spent a
handful of gold ounces in a Genoese posada at Seville and at a
bull-fight at Madrid, that he might be competent to tell the
world that Cervantes sneered Spain&rsquo;s chivalry away, is
superlatively Borrovian&mdash;and delicious.&nbsp; The entire

to save himself from death as an impostor, embraced the faith of

doubtful.&nbsp; Before the invasion of Spain by the Arabs, a
small town of Ph&oelig;nician origin, known as Karnattah, existed
near Illiberis (Elvira), and probably on the site of the more
modern city of Granada.&nbsp; The syllable <i>Kar</i> would, in
Ph&oelig;nician, signify &ldquo;a town.&rdquo;&nbsp; The meaning
of <i>nattah</i> is unknown (Gayangos, i. 347; Casiri, <i>Bib.
Ar. Hisp. Esc.</i>, ii. 251; Conde, <i>Hist. Dom.</i>, i. pp.
37&ndash;51).&nbsp; The supposition that the city owes its name
to its resemblance to a ripe pomegranate (<i>granada</i>) is
clearly inadmissible.&nbsp; As in the case of Leon, the device
was adopted in consequence of its appropriateness to an existing
name&mdash;although the modern city of Granada is probably not
older than 1020.&nbsp; The Arabic word, moreover, for a
pomegranate is <i>rom&agrave;n</i>; and Soto de Roma, the name of
the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s estate in Andalusia, means
&ldquo;the wood of the pomegranates;&rdquo; and an <i>ensalada
romana</i> is not a Roman, but a pomegranate salad (see Pedaza,
<i>Hist. Eccl. de Granada</i> [1618], fol. 21, 22; Romey,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
